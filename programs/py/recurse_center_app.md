# What is the most fascinating thing you've learned in the past month?

It took a bit longer than a month, but I recently finished reading "The Prize", a history of the global petroleum industry. Since the first oil well was drilled in Pennsylvania in 1859, the industry has alternated between periods of glut where new sources drive the price of oil below the cost of production, leading to waste and consolidation, and periods of shortage, which spur government support for costly new exploration efforts like offshore drilling. It's fascinating how the conditions of one period of glut precipitate the next period of shortage, and vice versa. Although this cycle has happened several times since 1859, the political and technological landscape has changed dramatically each time: for example, shifting from vertically integrated global corporations owning oil concessions around the world to nationalized oil producers selling to a financialized global marketplace of refinement and distribution. Of course, the dynamics of the oil industry also effect the political and technological landscape as well, and it's interesting similarities in the present commitization of ML APIs.

# What do you want to be doing in two years?

I want to be at the peak of my abilities as an individual contributor, a T-shaped generalist software engineer with a strong technical specialization in some area of platform engineering. I want to be beginning to combine these technical skills with a body of domain knowledge (for example, I've developed a knowledge of the art market, but I've since decided that it's not something I want to be domain expert in long term.) I want to be leading without explicit authority, helping people cope with the stress of adapting to a world that's rapidly changing, sometimes in disturbing ways.

# Why do you want to attend RC? How would attending RC be different than working on your own?

I think there's a number of orthogonal reasons I want to attend RC, all important:
- I want guidance in doing open-ended research and presenting it to others in a non-academic context
- I want to focus on more applied topics (like CI/CD, building example applications) that may not be the best fit for original academic research. But being a part of RC will give a good excuse to reach out to people in industry and ask about their experiences 
- I want to be able to adjust the scope of my research if someone gives me a better idea
- I don't want to overly focus on a particular domain
- I want to get a new job soon, so I have a limited time to pursue this research
- While I have a network of
- Volitional


# What would you like to work on at RC?
# E.g., things you want to learn or understand better, projects you want to build or contribute to, etc. Consider where the edge of your abilities is, and where youâ€™d like it to be at the end of your batch.

I'm interested in developing 


# Do you plan to attend RC in-person, remotely, or some combination of the two? How will this affect your working style?

In person, I live in Yorkville, Manhattan so I should be able to show up in person most days. I would adjust based on the amount of value I receive from going in person vs the extra time of the commute to Brooklyn. I already have a workspace that I rent downtown.

# What other commitments (work, life, family) would you have during your batch?
- Applying to jobs + interviewing
- Some amount of work on a side project business that I help manage

I'd be interesting integrating both of these into my work at RC if it makes sense.

# Describe your programming background in a few sentences.

I've been programming professionally since 2012.

# Do you have a Computer Science degree or are you seeking one?
I have a degree in Information Science from Cornell University.
