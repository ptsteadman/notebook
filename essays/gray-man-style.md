# (Don't) Be The Gray Man 

A few days after Trump was elected, one of my friends tweeted that he was going
to buy a gun. Months later, another friend quoted the tweet, gently dragging him
for not actually buying the gun.

While this behavior is a bit cringeworthy, I think it's the type of behavior we
should expect and encourage in a functioning democracy.

It would've been much worse if my friend had bought the gun, learned how to use
it, and told no one, blending in with his creative professional peers.

According to SurvivialThinkTank.com, a "gray man" is "an individual who
possesses the skills, ability and intent to blend into any situation or
surrounding without standing out, concealing his or her true skills, ability,
and intent from others." [3] The term "gray man" is currently used by
survivalists who believe that dressing and acting "gray" will improve their
chances if shit hits the fan (SHTF).

Promoters of gray man style believe that overt tactical gear is a
"shoot-me-first" signal, and instead prefer dress that will help them avoid
attention until it's time to use force. For example, a gray man wouldn't carry
one of the "bug out bags" recommended in this recent NYT article [25], because
the recommended bags include obvious military features like MOLLE panels,
hydration bladders, and camouflage. The gray man prefers to carry his weapons
and supplies in a dorky messenger bag like the Vertex EDC Satchel [8], designed
to "blend into everyday life" while still holding ballistic inserts and allowing
for rapid firearm draws.

Over the past few months, I've also come to see "gray" as an emergent (but
unspoken) political identity. The gray man tries to seem politically normal
while secretly harboring visions of a wide range of political scenarios, from
leftist cultural revolution to technocratic feudal separatism. Gray politics are
distinct from crypto-fascism or other crypto-politics in that gray politics
don't require belief in any one particular system: the gray man has no agenda
beyond his secret preparation. Even if he has nothing to say about the policy
debates of the present, he can feel important and enlightened as he prepares for
the politics of a future world.

Survival bloggers developed the gray man concept in reaction to a perceived
threat of "survivalist hate".

One blogger, Selco, uses his experiences during the Balkan war to motivate his
gray man theory. Selco writes that he saw some of his more prepared neighbors
give away supplies to those in need during the first few weeks of the conflict.
Just weeks later, many of these generous individuals were robbed or even
murdered. Selco says that thieves often justified their actions with the charge
that the well-prepared individuals were somehow guilty of anticipating or
catalyzing the chaos. A reviewer of Selco's survival course urges readers to
think back to high school, where "those who were prepared for the test were
hated and called nerds".  [16] 

Selco explicitly calls for his readers to practice being gray, and emphasizes
that being gray is a lifestyle that begins before shit hits the fan. He goes so
far as to recommend that parents keep supplies and weapons hidden from their
children, so that the children don't discuss it with their neighborhood friends.

The idea of gray man as a lifestyle seems to have originated with the term
itself.

The earliest writing I could find about the gray man concept is a post on the
"Western Rifle Shooters Association" blogspot, alongside posts about firearms
and anti-government politics. This piece, authored in a Goofus and Gallant
style, presents gray man as an identity. Example: "The Young Grey Man is
dismissed as a wimp, the Older as a doddering old fool." [7]

This quote begs the question: why be a survivalist if it's such a social
liability? Wouldn't it be better to accept the idea that survival is socially
determined?

American-style survivalism is tightly coupled with libertarian, individualist,
and anti-government politics. For politically active survivalists, being gray is
in tension with their desire to share and promote their political beliefs.
Perhaps as a way to ease this tension, the Western Rifle Shooters Association
post presents gray man as something that can be practiced with a group: "[The
Gray Man] practices with his weaponry in private, or only with his fellow Grey
Men, always in a secluded location."

In more recent articles about gray man, mostly found on survivalist content
farms, gray man is presented as situational strategy for use in a fantasy urban
survival scenario. For many younger survivalists, survivalism is less of a
political identity and more of a hobby.

Undercover agents and military professionals also make tactical use of gray man.
[27] To get an idea of what professional gray man looks like, consider the man
photographed in this tweet thread from Chelsea Manning: 

https://twitter.com/xychelsea/status/880963473437585408?lang=en

Manning states that this man's heavily rubberized business casual shoes leak the
fact that he's an undercover agent, prepared for violence.

When I talk about the gray man concept with my friends, many of them immediately
say something like: "so this is normcore for preppers/racists/republicans". And
it's true: the concept of gray man is similar to the concept of normcore as it
was originally defined by K-HOLE in 2013.[1] Normcore differs from gray man in
one key respect: motivation. K-HOLE says that normcore is "a path to a more
peaceful life", through the realization that "adaptability leads to belonging
and connection". Some stated motivations behind gray man include "keeping your
preps", "avoiding kinetic confrontation", and "[staving] the impending onslaught
of self-appointed have-nots". 

The concept of normcore as proposed by K-HOLE is quite different from normcore
as it has been implemented in culture. Normcore has a become an immediately
recognizable look that makes cool people look even cooler. The same sort of
process will likely happen with the gray man concept. Apparel companies will
capture the power of the gray man idea and distill it into a "look".

This might seem like a stretch, but here's some evidence.

In fashion industry, there's the emergence of camping chic and gorpcore.

__Camping chic__ was visible in the collections of Prada, Balenciaga and Vetements
last winter, and has reemerged in Spring/Summer 2018 looks, [13, 14, 15] along
with multi-modal utility looks in the collections of Rick Owens.  (Think large
holster-like leather pouches around the thigh).

Concurrently, the term __gorpcore__ was coined by NYMag journalist Jason Chen.
According to Chen, gorpcore has the same appeal of normcore, but instead of
idealizing the Mall, gorpcore idealizes the Woods. [12] In practice, gorpcore
seems to mean that Patagonia is cool again. (Activist DeRay McKesson famously
wears a blue Patagonia vest because it's practical and he broadly approves of
the company's environmental consciousness.) 

It has become normal for people everywhere on the political spectrum to talk of
impending collapse. The NYT and New Yorker have written tongue-in-cheek profiles
of survivalists, but these profiles will still serve as gateways into the
culture. [25] 

As these trends blend with cypherpunk and anarcho-primitivism and slough into
the mainstream, people will begin to restrain themselves, going gray. They will
want to just barely hint at their hidden skills and intent, and be ready to
move.

Articles about gray man style usually make the assumption that the reader is
innately capable of being a gray man. The two factors often discussed as
obstacles to being gray are: 1) being unusually short or tall, and 2) being a
woman who attracts sexual attention. Here's an example of advice given to women
on being gray:

"Be cognizant of any smells such as food, soap or gunpowder that someone would
relate to something they'd want. Try to think about what you do, say or wear
that may cause a connection to some kind of desire. This is especially important
for females. When SHTF, there will be very few gentlemen and those in power will
take what they want, without regard to repercussions. Be cognizant of innuendo
or movements such as arching your back or physical contact. They may put you in
a situation that you may not be able to get out of." [11]

One comment on a survival YouTube video points out that as a black man, "trying
to be a gray man will be difficult in far too many places in this country."
Another commenter responds with advice that echoes advice sometimes given to
black men in everyday life: try to be dismissed. The commenter links to a Vice
article where two British men discover that wearing neon hi-vis vests allows
them to escape attention and access restricted areas. [26]

For minorities in America, the acts necessary to survive disaster are often
criminalized or demonized. Many dramatic examples of this phenomenon occurred
during hurricane Katrina, when black families wading through the water with
supplies were infamously described as "looting" while white families were
described as "finding". [21] Police from the wealthy community of Gretna fired
shots over the heads of families trying to flee over a bridge into their
community, a stark example of how borders can suddenly form in disaster. In
another case, police killed an unarmed child and a mentally disabled man who
were attempting to make their way over a bridge to a family friend's home. The
officers were only prosecuted in 2012, after a cover-up that spanned years.

Gray man theorists often note that in a disaster, it's usually best to stay at
home. Being gray is a response to situations where one has to "traverse areas
outside your home for various reasons", such as  "supply runs" and "information
gathering". [19]

In a post-SHTF world, wouldn't an armed person with survival skills on a "supply
run" be a dangerous predator?

Being a *white* gray man is convenient, because it allows a white person to
hoard his or her weapons and supplies, but still be considered a victim worthy
of assistance. 

A wolf in sheep's clothing.

Just as affecting a folksy down-to-earthness helps people like
George Bush and Warren Buffet retain power and goodwill, affecting a dorky
harmlessness while keeping one's assets hidden will be a powerful strategy for
the 21st century.

Some aspects of left accelerationism (or "l/acc") are reminiscent of the gray
man ethos. For example, here's a quote from the "Accelerationist Manifesto":

"The fetishisation of openness, horizontality, and inclusion of much of today's
'radical' left set the stage for ineffectiveness. Secrecy, verticality, and
exclusion all have their place as well in effective political action (though
not, of course, an exclusive one)."

If the left attempts to adopt the gray man concept and use it for progressive
activism, the effort may backfire.

Attempts to move away from endless dialogue towards secret organizing and direct
action may be destabilizing. While it's fun to make fun of the dynamics of
virtue signaling on social media, a society where many people have 'gray'
identities and belief systems is quietly primed for chaos. And, as noted in the
previous section, chaos and disaster will most likely lead to a very regressive
distribution of suffering.

I've touched on three different ways to be the gray man.

The first is _tactical use of gray man_, useful for someone who wants to stalk
Chelsea Manning, forage for food post-SHTF, or fit in at school.

The second way is _grayness as conscious part of one's identity_, useful for
survivalists who want to hoard without facing the social consequences of their
hoarding.

The final way is _grayness as an unconscious part of one's identity_, especially
one's political identity. It's not particularly unusual for someone to profess a
political alignment (ex: socialist) that is inconsistent with the future they're
preparing for (ex: anarcho-capitalist). Usually, this inconsistency is the
result of everyday expediencies and limitations, and is only experienced as
cognitive dissonance.  But when a person begins to feel like they have some sort
of secret "edge" because of their hedging and dissembling, they are becoming the
gray man, even if they don't realize it.
