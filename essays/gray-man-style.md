Headline: What is Gray Man Style?

---

The idea of Gray Man Style is that in a "shit hits the fan" scenario, you don't
want to stand out, you want to blend in. But you also want to have the weapons,
tools, and supplies you need to survive. So while normcore developed a
distinctive, easily identifiable visual langauge (dad jeans and ...), gray man
style is only successful when it's not identifiable.  One key aspect of gray man
style is that it's intensely utilitarian. The notion of the gray man was
developed largely by preppers and survivalists as a response to a fantasy urban
survival scenario. SurvivialThinkTank.com defines a 'gray man' as 'an
individual who possesses the skills, ability and intent to blend into any
situation or surrounding without standing out, concealing his or her true
skills, ability, and intent from others.' This idea could be applied to
individuals besides survivalists. It may be desireable in certain situations to
someone with true skills, ability, and intent, to conceal their true nature. In
other situations, it might be desireable to clearly signal those abilities and
intentions, to inspire solidarity, identity or prevent confusion. The idea of
gray man style includes the notion of different 'phases':

Smells

"Be cognizant of any smells such as food, soap or gunpowder that someone would
relate to something they’d want. Try to think about what you do, say or wear
that may cause a connection to some kind of desire. This is especially important
for females. When SHTF, there will be very few gentlemen and those in power will
take what they want, without regard to repercussions. Be cognizant of innuendo
or movements such as arching your back or physical contact. They may put you in
a situation that you may not be able to get out of."

Therefore grey man clothing is often 'transformable' in some way, in order to
swtich between contexts.
