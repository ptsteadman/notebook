# Gray Man Style

A few days after the election, one of my friends tweeted that he was going to
buy a gun. About six months later, another friend quoted the tweet, gently
dragging him for not actually buying the gun.

While this behavior might make you cringe, I think it's the type of behavior we
should expect and encourage in a functioning democracy.

It would've been much worse if my friend had bought the gun, learned how to use
it, and told no one, blending in with his creative professional peers.

SurvivialThinkTank.com defines a "gray man" as "an individual who possesses the
skills, ability and intent to blend into any situation or surrounding without
standing out, concealing his or her true skills, ability, and intent from
others." [3] The term 'gray man' is currently used by survivalists who think
that dressing and acting 'gray' will increase their chances of survival if shit
hits the fan (SHTF).

For example, promoters of gray man style believe that overt tactical gear is a
"shoot-me-first" signal, and instead favor multi-modal dress that will help them
avoid attention, at least until it's time to use force. A gray man wouldn't want
to be carrying one of the 'bug out bags' available on Amazon when shit hits the
fan, because most of the Amazon bags include obvious military features like
MOLLE panels, hydration bladders, and camouflage. [25] The gray man prefers to
carry his weapons and supplies in a dorky messenger bag like the Vertex EDC
Satchel [8], designed to 'blend into everyday life' while still holding
ballistic inserts and allowing for rapid firearm draws.

Over the past few months, I've also come to see 'gray' as an emergent (but
unspoken) political identity. The gray man political stance is similar to gray
man style: try to appear normal, but be prepared for as much as possible. Gray
man politics are distinct from crypto-fascism or other crypto-politics in the
respect that gray politics are purely solipistic and don't require belief in any
one particular system: the gray man has no secret agenda beyond his secret
preparation. Even if he has nothing to say about the policy debates of the
present, he can feel important and enlightened as he prepares the for the
politics of a future world.

I think that most people with essentially 'gray' politics don't realize how
similar their value systems are to a certain type of survivalist.  It's fun to
criticize mall ninjas, Silicon Valley survivalists, and the dynamics of virtue
signaling on social media, but a society where many people have 'gray'
identities and belief systems always has the potential for sudden chaos. It's
hard to imagine democratic processes thriving in a society of gray men who
secretly harbor fatalist, apolitical visions of surviving in scenarios ranging
from leftist cultural revolution to technocratic feudal seperatism. I think it
is also quite normal to secretly enjoy the pleasures of the neoliberal
lifestyle, and not really expect them to stop, while professing a
socially-acceptable desire for revolution.

The gray man concept seems to have been developed in reaction to a perceived
threat of "survivalist hate". A individual known as Selco bases his theory of
survivalist hate on his experience in the Balkan war, where he saw many
well-prepared people attempt to help their neighbors by giving away supplies.
Just weeks later, these generous individuals were often rewarded by being robbed
or even murdered. Selco says that the thieves justified their actions with the
notion that well-prepared individuals were somehow guilty of anticipating or
catalyzing the conflict. A reviewer of Selco's survival course simply asks
readers to think back to high school, where those who "were prepared for the
test were hated and called nerds". [16]

Gray man adherents seem to believe that the attention economy would invert
itself in a SHTF scenario: those who attract less attention will be more likely
to survive or even thrive. This is echoed in military use of the gray man term,
where POWs and trainees are encouraged to "be the gray man". [27]

Selco emphasizes that being grey is a lifestyle that begins even before shit
hits the fan. He goes so far as to recommend that parents keep supplies and
weapons hidden from their children, so that the children don't discuss it with
their friends.

This emphasis of gray man as a lifestyle seems to have originated with the term
itself.

The earliest reference I could find online to the gray man concept is a post on
the "Western Rifle Shooters Association" blogspot, alongside posts about
firearms and anti-government politics. This piece, authored in a Goofus and
Gallant style, presents gray man as more of an identity than a strategy.
Example: "The Young Grey Man is dismissed as a wimp, the Older as a doddering
old fool." [7]

This quote begs the obvious question: why be a survivalist anyways, if it can be
such a liability that you need to develop a pathetic alter-ego? Wouldn't it be
better to accept the idea that survival is socially determined?

The obvious reason that most survivalists don't focus on the survival of society
as a whole is that American-style survivalism is tightly coupled with
libertarian, individualist, and anti-government politics. For these politically
active survivalists, being gray is in tension with their desire to share and
promote their political beliefs. Perhaps as a way to ease this tension, the
Western Rifle Shooters Association post presents gray man as something that can
be practiced secretly with a group: "[The Gray Man] practices with his weaponry
in private, or only with his fellow Grey Men, always in a secluded location."

I found later writing about the gray man concept on a number of different
survivalist content farms. In these later pieces, gray man is less of a
lifestyle ideal than a situational strategy for use in a fantasy urban survival
scenario, recycled for clickbait purposes. For many younger survivalists,
survivalism is less of a political position and more of a hobby.  The tension
that these later adopters face is instead a tension between wanting to share
their hobby and wanting to actually survive if SHTF.

Undercover agents and military professionals also make tactical use of gray man.
To get an idea of what professional gray man looks like, consider the man
photographed in this tweet thread from Chelsea Manning: 

https://twitter.com/xychelsea/status/880963473437585408?lang=en

Manning states that this man's heavily rubberized business casual shoes leak the
fact that he's an undercover agent, prepared for violence at any moment.

When I described the gray man concepts to my friends, many of them immediately
said something along the lines of "so this is normcore for
preppers/racists/republicans". And it's true: the concept of gray man is very
similar to the concept of normcore as it was originally defined by K-HOLE in
2013.[1] Note that this abstract concept is quite different to how normcore has
been implemented in culture. Normcore differs from gray man in one key respect:
the motivations behind each concept and practice. K-HOLE says that normcore is
"a path to a more peaceful life", through the realization that "adaptability
leads to belonging and connection". Some stated motivations behind gray man
include "keeping your preps, "avoiding kinetic confrontation", and "[staving]
the impending onslaught of self-appointed have-nots". 

Normcore has a become an immediately recognizable look that makes cool people
look even cooler. I think that the same sort of process will happen with the
gray man concept. Apparel companies will capture the power of the gray man idea
and distill it into a "look".

This might seem like a stretch, but here's some evidence.

In the world of fashion, we can look to the emergence of camping chic and
gorpcore. Camping chic was visible in the collections of Prada, Balenciaga and
Vetements last winter, and has reemerged in Spring/Summer 2018 looks, [13, 14,
15] along with utility or "tactical" black in the collections of Rick Owens.
(Think large holster-like leather pouches around the thigh). Concurrently, the
term gorpcore was coined by NYMag journalist Jason Chen, who said that it had
the same appeal as normcore, but instead of idealizing the Mall, gorpcore
idealizes the Woods. [12] In practice, gorpcore seems to mean that Patagonia is
cool again. Chen notes that one could make the argument that gorpcore is rooted
in post-election malaise, like just about everything else in contemporary
culture. He points out that activist DeRay McKesson famously wears a blue
Patagonia vest, because it's practical and he approves of the company's
environmental consciousness.

In the post-election malaise, it's also become normal for people everywhere on
the political spectrum to talk of impending collapse. The NYT and New Yorker
have written many tongue-in-cheek profiles of survivalists, but these profiles
may still serve as gateways into the culture. [25] 

I think that these trends will eventually meet somewhere, blending with
cypherpunk and anarcho-primitivism. As everything sloughs into the mainstream,
those in the know will begin to restrain and subvert themselves, becoming gray.
They will want to just barely hint at their hidden skills and intent, and be
ready to move.

Articles about gray man style usually make the assumption that the reader is
innately capable of being a gray man. The two factors discussed as obstacles to
becoming gray are: 1) being unusually short or tall, or 2) being a woman who
attracts sexual attention. To get an idea of the advice given to women about how
to be gray, here's an example from Gray Wolf Survival:

"Be cognizant of any smells such as food, soap or gunpowder that someone would
relate to something they'd want. Try to think about what you do, say or wear
that may cause a connection to some kind of desire. This is especially important
for females. When SHTF, there will be very few gentlemen and those in power will
take what they want, without regard to repercussions. Be cognizant of innuendo
or movements such as arching your back or physical contact. They may put you in
a situation that you may not be able to get out of." [11]

One comment on a survival YouTube video points out that as a black man, "trying
to be a gray man will be difficult in far too many places in this country." For
minorities in America, the acts necessary to survive a disaster are often
criminalized or demonized, most dramatically in hurricane Katrina, where black
families wading through the water with supplies were infamously described as
'looting' while a white family was described as 'finding'. [21] It went beyond
media: police from the wealthy community of Gretna fired shots over the head of
families trying to flee over a bridge into their community.  In another case,
police killed an unarmed child and a mentally disabled man who were attempting
to make their way over a bridge to a family friend's home, also shooting four
others. The officers were only prosecuted in 2012, after a cover-up that spanned
years. Survivalists seem to ignore the fact that in actual disasters, they would
likely not be the ones to suffer.

Articles about being gray often include the caveat that it's best to simply stay
at home in a disaster, and that being gray is a response to situations where one
has to "traverse areas outside your home for various reasons". [19] These
various reasons generally include "supply runs" and "information gathering". In
a post-SHTF world, wouldn't an armed person with survival skills be on a "supply
run" be a dangerous predator? In Katrina, when shit really hit the fan, many civilians
with weapons and guns ended up being predators, not potential prey.

Being a *white* gray man works, because it allows a white man to hide his or her
weapons and supplies, but still be considered a victim worthy of assistance.

The advice on the internet for minority gray men seems to echo the advice given
to black men in everyday life: try to be dismissed. One writer points to a Vice
article where two British men discover that "Hi-Vis Vests Get You Into
Everything For Free". [26]

So, while the political left might want to adopt the gray man concept and create
a 'gray bloc' to complement the black bloc, I think the gray man concept is dead
on arrival as a progressive tool. At best, I think gray man could be a good
identity for someone sick of competing in the attention economy. Finally, almost
every gray man article mentions the importance of also being gray online. Being
cybergray might be a good strategy for someone planning to commit cyberviolence.

The article assumes that as society inevitably progresses from Phase 0 to Phase
3, carrying weapons and supplies become less unusual, and thus more acceptable
to the gray man. But, because chaos often emerges rapidly (SurvialThinkTank
tellingly uses the example of "racially-motivated flash mobs" [2]), gray man
clothing and gear is often transformable in some way, to enable transitions
between different balances of stealth and kit in evolving situations.
