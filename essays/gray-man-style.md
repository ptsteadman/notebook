Headline: What is Gray Man Style?

---

Gray man style is a school of thought developed by survivalists who want to
conceal their skills, weapons, and goals by blending into their surroundings.
Promoters of gray man style dismiss 'shoot-me-first' tactical gear as a form of
virtue signaling, and instead favor multi-modal dress that will help them avoid
attention until it is time to use force. Some 'gray man directives' include:
avoid having a noticeable scent, wear this messenger bag instead of a backpack;
if you're a woman: don't arch your back.

I want to look into:

- Where the term 'gray man' comes from.
- What does gray man style look like? (examples)
- How the fashion industry has adpoted gray man concepts and looks.
- What does gray man style reveal about the people who came up with it?
- Is it possible for non-male, non-white, or queer people to be a gray man?
- How activists and aid workers could use the gray man concept to be more effective.

1. What's the gray man concept?

SurvivialThinkTank.com defines a "gray man" as "an individual who possesses the
skills, ability and intent to blend into any situation or surrounding without
standing out, concealing his or her true skills, ability, and intent from
others." Promoters of gray man style dismiss overt tactical gear as a
"shoot-me-first" signal, and instead favor multi-modal dress that will help them
avoid attention until it's time to use force.

You probably know what a "go bag" is. The New York Times recently wrote a piece
about state-of-the-art go bags available for purchase on Amazon. Many of these
are ruggidized and include military features like Mole webbing, aluminum frames,
and camoflauge. From the perspective of the gray man, this is a very poor choice
of a bug out bag, just as army surplus desert combat boots. Both of these items
of gear are likely to "trigger an onlooker's Reticular Activating System", and
signal that the wearer is a survivalist, or at least happens to have supplies.
The gray man would prefer to carry his weapons and supplies in a dorky messenger
bag like this, which is actually designed for rapid drawing of a firearm and can
accomodate armor plating. In this bag, the molle is hidden beneath a case for
your phone. Another gray man theorist has used an beat up old 

"cost you your preps or even your life"

Some 'gray man directives' include: avoid having a noticeable scent, wear this
messenger bag instead of a backpack; if you're a woman: don't arch your back.

SurvivalThinkTank expands the idea of the gray man to a context-dependent
"directive" broken up into four phases. Each of the four phases corresponds to a
general threat level, from present-day small town Main Street to full on road
warrior situation. For SurvivalThinkTank, the key tradeoff for the gray man is
between Stealth and Firepower/Kit. The transition from phase 0 to phase 3 is
assumed to be inevitable, and as that as society breaks down, carrying firearms
and supplies will be normal, and thus gray. It's also noted that situations can
rapidly escalate.

In a SHTF scenario, the attention economy would likely invert itself, and those
who attract less attention. People interested in the gray man idea are cognizant
of they call "survivalist hate".


Instinctual, environmental, situation depedendent
staying home / be careful what you post online

"You should have no memorable smell."

socially determined

This begs the obvious question: why be a survivalist
anyways, if it can be such a liability? So, one aspect of gray man style is that
it's intensely utilitarian.

So, what's the difference between gray man and the practices of undercover
agents? For example, consider this tweet thread from Chelsea Manning:   

3. Where does gray man come from?

Where does the gray man concept come from? Does it come from the military, is it
survivalist copypasta, or just common sense? Do people actually practice gray
man? 

The earliest reference I could find online to the concept of the gray man is in
a blogpost on the "Western Rifle Shooters Association" website, alongside
numberous other articles about firearms, survival, and anti-government politics.
This piece, authored by someone called Habcap in a Goofus and Gallant style,
presents gray man as more of an identity than a strategy. Moreover, Habcap
presents gray man as soething that can be practiced in a group: "[The Gray Man]
practices with his weaponry in private, or only with his fellow Grey Men, always
in a secluded location."

Later discussions of the gray man seem to have adapted t largely by
preppers and survivalists as a response to a fantasy urban survival scenario.

4. The fashion industry and gray man

When I described the gray man concepts to my friends, most of them immediately
said something along the lines of "so this is normcore for
preppers/racists/republicans". And it's true: the abstract concept of gray man
is very similar to the concept of normcore as it was originally defined by
K-HOLE[1].  (Note that this abstract concept is quite different to how normcore
has been implemented in culture.) But normcore differs from gray man in one key
respect: the ostensible motivations behind each concept and associated practice.
K-HOLE says that normcore is "a path to a more peaceful life", through the
realization that "adaptability leads to belonging and connection". Some stated
motivations behind gray man include "staying alive", "avoiding kinetic
confrontation", and "[staving] the impending onslaught of self-appointed
have-nots". 

For example, [2]. Dealing with the fact that survival is socially determined,
not individualistic. Survivalists live in the 'real world'.

Normcore has a become an immediately recognizable look that makes cool people
look even cooler. I think that the same sort of process is starting to happen
with the gray man concept. Apparel companies are capturing the power of the gray
man idea and distilling it into a "look".

What's the % of clothing that is 'tactical'.

Normcore in practice has come to be a way of signaling one's deep coolness. Gray
man style in practice will be a way to signal one's deep uncoolness.

5. Who can be a gray man?

Writing about the gray man concept seems to usually make the assumption that the
reader is capable of being the gray man. The two main body factors that are
typically discussed as factors that would make it difficult to be gray area
being unusually short or tall, or being a woman who attracts sexual attention.

"Be cognizant of any smells such as food, soap or gunpowder that someone would
relate to something they’d want. Try to think about what you do, say or wear
that may cause a connection to some kind of desire. This is especially important
for females. When SHTF, there will be very few gentlemen and those in power will
take what they want, without regard to repercussions. Be cognizant of innuendo
or movements such as arching your back or physical contact. They may put you in
a situation that you may not be able to get out of."

"Ever had a conversation with someone who you’re attracted to and have just one
movement or sentence switch you from being somewhat detached to thinking about
sex?"

o "supply runs" vs looting
Obviously, just from the name, the gray man concept is pretty fucked from a
social justice perspective.  "getting supplies" -> white man's looting

6. The gray rescuer, the gray bloc

If someone asks you "Are you heading to a safe house, do you have someplace safe
to stay?" you can easily respond with "I am looking for [my brother.]" [6]

"Don't play the hero or the villain." [4]
