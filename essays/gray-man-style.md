# Gray Man Style

A few days after the election, one of my friends tweeted that he was going to
buy a gun. Six months later, another friend quoted the tweet, gently dragging
him for not actually buying the gun.

While this behavior might seem cringeworthy, I think it's the type of behavior
we should expect and encourage in a functioning democracy.

It would've been much worse if my friend had bought the gun, learned how to use
it, and told no one, blending in with his creative professional peers.

According to SurvivialThinkTank.com, a "gray man" is "an individual who
possesses the skills, ability and intent to blend into any situation or
surrounding without standing out, concealing his or her true skills, ability,
and intent from others." [3] The term "gray man" is currently used by
survivalists who believe that dressing and acting "gray" will increase their
chances of survival if shit hits the fan (SHTF).

For example, promoters of gray man style believe that overt tactical gear is a
"shoot-me-first" signal, and instead prefer multi-modal dress that will help
them avoid attention until it's time to use force. A gray man wouldn't want to
be carrying one of the "bug out bags" discussed in a recent NYT article, because
most of the bags mentioned include obvious military features like MOLLE panels,
hydration bladders, and camouflage. [25] The gray man prefers to carry his
weapons and supplies in a dorky messenger bag like the Vertex EDC Satchel [8],
designed to 'blend into everyday life' while still holding ballistic inserts and
allowing for rapid firearm draws.

Over the past few months, I've also come to see "gray" as an emergent (but
unspoken) political identity. The gray man tries to seem politically normal
while secretly harboring visions of a wide range of political scenarios, from
leftist cultural revolution to technocratic feudal seperatism. Gray politics are
distinct from crypto-fascism or other crypto-politics in the respect that gray
politics don't require belief in any one particular system: the gray man has no
agenda beyond his secret preparation. Even if he has nothing to say about the
policy debates of the present, he can feel important and enlightened as he
prepares the for the politics of a future world.

Survival bloggers developed the gray man concept in reaction to a perceived
threat of "survivalist hate". One blogger, Selco, is notable for basing his gray
man theory on his experience during the Balkan War. Selco says that he saw
well-prepared neighbors give away supplies in the first few weeks of the
conflict. Just weeks later, many of these generous individuals were robbed or
even murdered. Selco says that the thieves justified their actions with
the idea that the well-prepared individuals were somehow guilty of anticipating
or catalyzing the chaos. A reviewer of Selco's survival course encourages
readers to think back to high school, where those who "were prepared for the
test were hated and called nerds". [16] 

Selco explicitly calls for his readers to practice being gray, and emphasizes
that being gray is a lifestyle that begins before shit hits the fan. He goes so
far as to recommend that parents keep supplies and weapons hidden from their
children, so that the children don't discuss it with their neighborhood friends.

The idea of gray man as a lifestyle seems to have originated with the term
itself.

The earliest reference I could find to the gray man concept is a post on the
"Western Rifle Shooters Association" blogspot, alongside posts about firearms
and anti-government politics. This piece, authored in a Goofus and Gallant
style, presents gray man as more of an identity than a strategy.  Example: "The
Young Grey Man is dismissed as a wimp, the Older as a doddering old fool." [7]

This quote begs the question: why be a survivalist if it's such a social
liability that one must develop a pathetic alter-ego? Wouldn't it be better to
accept the notion that survival is socially determined?

Most survivalists don't focus on the survival of society as a whole because
American-style survivalism is tightly coupled with libertarian, individualist,
and anti-government politics. For politically active survivalists, being gray is
in tension with their desire to share and promote their political beliefs.
Perhaps as a way to ease this tension, the Western Rifle Shooters Association
post presents gray man as something that can be practiced with a group: "[The
Gray Man] practices with his weaponry in private, or only with his fellow Grey
Men, always in a secluded location."

In more recent articles on survivalist content farm sites, gray man is presented
as a situational strategy for use in a fantasy urban survival scenario. For many
younger survivalists, survivalism is less of a political identity and more of a
hobby.

Undercover agents and military professionals also make tactical, temporary use
of gray man. [27] To get an idea of what professional gray man looks like, consider
the man photographed in this tweet thread from Chelsea Manning: 

https://twitter.com/xychelsea/status/880963473437585408?lang=en

Manning states that this man's heavily rubberized business casual shoes leak the
fact that he's an undercover agent, prepared for violence at any moment.

When I talk about the gray man concept with my friends, many of them immediately
say something along the lines of: "so this is normcore for
preppers/racists/republicans". And it's true: the concept of gray man is very
similar to the concept of normcore as it was originally defined by K-HOLE in
2013.[1]  Normcore differs from gray man in one key respect: the ostensible
motivations behind each concept. K-HOLE says that normcore is "a path to a more
peaceful life", through the realization that "adaptability leads to belonging
and connection". Some stated motivations behind gray man include "keeping your
preps", "avoiding kinetic confrontation", and "[staving] the impending onslaught
of self-appointed have-nots". 

The concept of normcore as proposed by K-HOLE is quite different from normcore
as it has been implemented in culture. Normcore has a become an immediately
recognizable look that makes cool people look even cooler. I think that the same
sort of process will happen with the gray man concept. Apparel companies will
capture the power of the gray man idea and distill it into a "look".

This might seem like a stretch, but here's some evidence.

In fashion industry, there's the emergence of camping chic and gorpcore.

__Camping chic__ was visible in the collections of Prada, Balenciaga and Vetements
last winter, and has reemerged in Spring/Summer 2018 looks, [13, 14, 15] along
with utility or "tactical" looks in the collections of Rick Owens.  (Think large
holster-like leather pouches around the thigh).

Concurrently, the term __gorpcore__ was coined by NYMag journalist Jason Chen.
According to Chen, gorpcore has the same appeal of normcore, but instead of
idealizing the Mall, gorpcore idealizes the Woods. [12] In practice, gorpcore
seems to mean that Patagonia is cool again. Chen writes that that gorpcore is
arguably rooted in post-election malaise. He points out that activist DeRay
McKesson famously wears a blue Patagonia vest, because it's practical and he
approves of the company's environmental consciousness.

It has become normal for people everywhere on the political spectrum to talk of
impending collapse. The NYT and New Yorker have written tongue-in-cheek profiles
of survivalists, but these profiles still serve as gateways into the culture.
[25] 

I think that these trends will eventually meet somewhere, informed by cypherpunk
and anarcho-primitivism. As everything sloughs into the mainstream, people will
begin to restrain themselves, becoming gray. They will want to just barely hint
at their hidden skills and intent, and be ready to move.

Articles about gray man style usually make the assumption that the reader is
innately capable of being a gray man. The two factors often discussed as
obstacles to being gray are: 1) being unusually short or tall, or 2) being a
woman who attracts sexual attention. Here's an example of advice given to women
on being gray:

"Be cognizant of any smells such as food, soap or gunpowder that someone would
relate to something they'd want. Try to think about what you do, say or wear
that may cause a connection to some kind of desire. This is especially important
for females. When SHTF, there will be very few gentlemen and those in power will
take what they want, without regard to repercussions. Be cognizant of innuendo
or movements such as arching your back or physical contact. They may put you in
a situation that you may not be able to get out of." [11]

One comment on a survival YouTube video points out that as a black man, "trying
to be a gray man will be difficult in far too many places in this country."

The advice on the internet for minority gray men seems to echo the advice given
to black men in everyday life: try to be dismissed. One writer points to a Vice
article where two British men discover that wearing neon hi-vis vests allows
them to escape attention and access restricted areas. [26]

For minorities in America, the acts necessary to survive a disaster are often
criminalized or demonized. The most dramatic example of this phenomenon occured
in hurricane Katrina, where black families wading through the water with
supplies were infamously described as "looting" while a white family was
described as "finding". [21] Police from the wealthy community of Gretna fired
shots over the heads of families trying to flee over a bridge from New Orleans
into their community, a stark example of how borders can suddenly form in a
disaster. In another case, police killed an unarmed child and a mentally
disabled man who were attempting to make their way over a bridge to a family
friend's home. The officers were only prosecuted in 2012, after a cover-up that
spanned years.

Many gray man theorists note that in a disaster, it's usually best to stay at
home. Being gray is for situations where one has to "traverse areas outside your
home for various reasons". [19] These reasons generally include "supply runs"
and "information gathering". In a post-SHTF world, wouldn't an armed person with
survival skills on a "supply run" be a dangerous predator?

Being a *white* gray man works, because it allows a white person to hoard his or
her weapons and supplies, but still be considered a victim worthy of assistance.
Just as affecting a folksy down-to-earthness helps people like George Bush and
Warren Buffet retain power, affecting a dorky harmlessness while keeping one's
assets hidden and deniable will be a powerful strategy for the 21st century.

If the left attempts to adopt the gray man concept and use it for progressive
activism, the effort may backfire. Some aspects of the left accelerationist
project (or "l/acc") remind me of the gray man ethos. For example, here's a
quote from the "Accelerationist Manifesto":

"The fetishisation of openness, horizontality, and inclusion of much of today's
'radical' left set the stage for ineffectiveness. Secrecy, verticality, and
exclusion all have their place as well in effective political action (though
not, of course, an exclusive one)."

The understandable desire to move away from virtue signaling towards secret
organizing and direct action can be regressive and destablising. It's fun to
drag the dynamics of virtue signaling, but a society where many people have
'gray' identities and belief systems always has the potential for sudden chaos.
And, as noted in the previous section, chaos and disaster will most likely lead
to disproportionate suffering among the people that leftists hope to help.

Having gray projects and beliefs makes you feel important, but in the 21st
century, it's a mindset more appropriate for venture capitalists and mass
shooters than activists and concerned citizens.

crypto

It's better to de-gray and reintegrate.




anti-accelerationist

Many people secretly enjoy the pleasures of the neoliberal lifestyle and don't
really expect them to stop, while professing a socially-acceptable desire for
revolution. The gray man might even  a future world that he secretly thinks will
remain much like the neoliberal present.
