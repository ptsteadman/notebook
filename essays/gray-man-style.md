Headline: What is Gray Man Style?

---

Gray man style is a school of thought developed by survivalists who want to
conceal their skills, weapons, and goals by blending into their surroundings.
Promoters of gray man style dismiss 'shoot-me-first' tactical gear as a form of
virtue signaling, and instead favor multi-modal dress that will help them avoid
attention until it is time to use force. Some 'gray man directives' include:
avoid having a noticeable scent, wear this messenger bag instead of a backpack;
if you're a woman: don't arch your back.

I want to look into:

- Where the term 'gray man' comes from.
- What does gray man style look like? (examples)
- How the fashion industry has adpoted gray man concepts and looks.
- What does gray man style reveal about the people who came up with it?
- Is it possible for non-male, non-white, or queer people to be a gray man?
- How activists and aid workers could use the gray man concept to be more effective.

SurvivialThinkTank.com defines a "gray man" as "an individual who possesses the
skills, ability and intent to blend into any situation or surrounding without
standing out, concealing his or her true skills, ability, and intent from
others." Gray man is a concept developed by realist, socially-conscious
survivalists who've decided that'd rather not broadcast their prepper
identities. Promoters of gray man style dismiss overt tactical gear as a
"shoot-me-first" signal, and instead favor multi-modal dress that will help them
avoid attention until it's time to use force.

You probably know what a "bug out bag" is. The New York Times recently wrote a
piece about the state-of-the-art bug out bags available on Amazon. Many of these
include overt military features like MOLLE panels, hydration bladders, and
camoflauge.  From the perspective of the gray man, this type of bag is a very
poor choice for a bug out bag. Tactical items are likely to "trigger an
onlooker's Reticular Activating System (RAS)" [4] , and make the wearer
noteworthy: as a survivalist, or at least a person likely to have supplies.  The
gray man would prefer to carry his weapons and supplies in a dorky messenger bag
like the Vertex EDC Satchel [8], designed to 'blend into everyday life' and
accomodate rapid drawing of firearms and armor plating. Another gray man
theorist suggests using a seemingly beat-up old golf bag to wheel around rifles
and supplies. [9]

SurvivalThinkTank expands the idea of the gray man to a context-dependent
"directive" broken up into four phases. Each of the four phases corresponds to a
level of societal breakdown, from present-day small town America (Phase 0) to a
full-on "road warrior" situation (Phase 3). For SurvivalThinkTank, the key
tradeoff for the gray man is between Stealth and Firepower/Kit.

The transition from Phase 0 to Phase 3 is assumed to be inevitable, and also
assumes that as society collapses, carrying weapons and supplies will be more
necessary and more common, and thus acceptable to the gray man. But, because
chaos often emerges rapidly (SurvialThinkTank tellingly uses the example of
"racially-motivated flash mobs" [2]), gray man style is often transformable in
some way, to enable transitions between different balances of stealth and kit in
evolving situations.

The gray man concept seems to have been developed in reaction to percieved
"survivalist hate". A survival course taught by an individual known as "Selco"
who reportedly survived the Balkan war emphasizes the fact that at the beginning
of the conflict, many well-prepared people helped out their neighbors by giving
away supplies. Weeks later, most were robbed or even murdered, with the
justification that the well-prepared individuals were somehow guilty of hoping
for or catalyzing the conflict.

Selco emphasizes that being grey is a lifestyle that begins even before shit
hits the fan. He goes so far as to recommend that parents keep supplies and
weapons hidden from their children, so that the children don't discuss it with
their friends, who might then tell their parents. In general, gray man
proponents seem to believe that the attention economy would invert itself in a
SHTF scenario, and those who attract less attention would be more likely to
survive.

This emphasis of gray man as a lifestyle seems to have originated with the term
itself.

The earliest reference I could find online to the concept of the gray man is in
a blogpost on the "Western Rifle Shooters Association" website, alongside
numberous other articles about firearms, survival, and anti-government politics.
This piece, authored by someone called Habcap in a sort of Goofus and Gallant
style, presents gray man as more of an identity than a strategy. "The Young Grey
Man is dismissed as a wimp, the Older as a doddering old fool." Also, Habcap
presents gray man as something that can be practiced in a group: "[The Gray Man]
practices with his weaponry in private, or only with his fellow Grey Men, always
in a secluded location."

This all begs the obvious question: why be a survivalist anyways, if it can be
such a liability? Wouldn't it be better to deal with the fact that survival is
socially determined, and not just individually determined?

I think the answer to this question, from the position of the gray man, is that
survivalism is a political position interwined with other libertarian,
conservative, and anti-government politics. This is clear from the context of
the early acticles establishing the gray man concept: information about second
amendment law, tea party activism, and legal research tools. For these
libertarian survivalists, being gray is in tension with their desire to share
their political beliefs, and many comments on the Habcap article discuss this
conflict.

Later discussions of the gray man concept seem to be centered on survivalist
content farms as a response to a fantasy urban survival scenario, and to promote
certain survival tactics and gear. In these later pieces, gray man is less of a
lifestyle ideal than a situational strategy, recycled for clickbait purposes.
For later adopters of survivalist practices, survivalism is less of a political
position and more of a hobby. The tension that these later adopters face is
therefore a tension between wanting to share their hobby and wanting to actually
survive a SHTF scenario.

Undercover agents also make tactical use of gray man, even if they don't call it
gray man. For example, consider the man photographed in this tweet thread from
Chelsea Manning: 

https://twitter.com/xychelsea/status/880963473437585408?lang=en

Manning argues that the man failed to be sufficiently gray. She states that his
heavily rubberized business casual shoes leak the fact that he's prepared for
violence at any moment.

When I described the gray man concepts to my friends, many of them immediately
said something along the lines of "so this is normcore for
preppers/racists/republicans". And it's true: the abstract concept of gray man
is very similar to the concept of normcore as it was originally defined by
K-HOLE[1].  (Note that this abstract concept is quite different to how normcore
has been implemented in culture.) But normcore differs from gray man in one key
respect: the ostensible motivations behind each concept and associated practice.
K-HOLE says that normcore is "a path to a more peaceful life", through the
realization that "adaptability leads to belonging and connection". Some stated
motivations behind gray man include "staying alive", "avoiding kinetic
confrontation", and "[staving] the impending onslaught of self-appointed
have-nots". 

Normcore has a become an immediately recognizable look that makes cool people
look even cooler. I think that the same sort of process will happen with the
gray man concept. Apparel companies will capture the power of the gray man idea
and distill it into a "look".

This might seem like a stretch, but here's some evidence.

In the world of fashion, we can look to the emergence of camping chic and
gorpcore. Camping chic was visible in the collections of Prada, Balenciaga and
Vetements last winter, and has reemerged in Spring/Summer 2018 looks, [13, 14,
15] along with utility or "tactical" black in the collections of Rick Owens.
(Think large holster-like leather pouches around the thigh). Concurrently, the
term gorpcore was coined by NYMag journalist Jason Chen, who said that it had
the same appeal as normcore, but instead of idealizing the Mall, gorpcore
idealizes the Woods. [12] In practice, gorpcore seems to mean that Patagonia is
cool again. Chen notes that one could make the argument that gorpcore is rooted
in post-election malaise, like just about everything else in contemporary
culture. He points out that activist DeRay McKesson famously wears a blue
Patagonia vest, because it's practical and he approves of the company's
environmental consciousness.

In the post-election malaise, it's also become normal for people everywhere on
the political spectrum to talk of impending collapse. The NYT and New Yorker
have written many tongue-in-cheek profiles of survivalists, but profiles that
still could serve as a gateway into the culture. I personally have noticed many
of my peers profess an interest in purchasing or learning to use weapons,
finding a bug out location, or stockpiling supplies.

I think that these trends will eventually meet somewhere, blending with
cyberpunk and anarcho-primitivism v2. As everything blends into the mainstream,
those in the know will begin to restrain and subvert themselves, becoming gray
in the process. 

Articles about the gray man style and the grey man concept usually make the
assumption that the reader is innately capable of being a gray man. The two main
factors discussed as obstacles to becoming gray are: 1) being unusually short or
tall, or 2) being a woman who attracts sexual attention. To get an idea of the
advice given to women about how to be gray, here's an example from Gray Wolf
Survival:

"Be cognizant of any smells such as food, soap or gunpowder that someone would
relate to something they'd want. Try to think about what you do, say or wear
that may cause a connection to some kind of desire. This is especially important
for females. When SHTF, there will be very few gentlemen and those in power will
take what they want, without regard to repercussions. Be cognizant of innuendo
or movements such as arching your back or physical contact. They may put you in
a situation that you may not be able to get out of." [11]

If someone asks you "Are you heading to a safe house, do you have someplace safe
to stay?" you can easily respond with "I am looking for [my brother.]" [6]

"Don't play the hero or the villain." [4]
