Headline: What is Gray Man Style?

---

Gray man style is a school of thought developed by survivalists who want to
conceal their skills, weapons, and goals by blending into their surroundings.
Promoters of gray man style dismiss 'shoot-me-first' tactical gear as a form of
virtue signaling, and instead favor multi-modal dress that will help them avoid
attention until it is time to use force. Some 'gray man directives' include:
avoid having a noticeable scent, wear this messenger bag instead of a backpack;
if you're a woman: don't arch your back.

I want to look into:

- Where the term 'gray man' comes from.
- What does gray man style look like? (examples)
- How the fashion industry has adpoted gray man concepts and looks.
- What does gray man style reveal about the people who came up with it?
- Is it possible for non-male, non-white, or queer people to be a gray man?
- How activists and aid workers could use the gray man concept to be more effective.

1. What's a grey man?

Gray man style is a school of thought developed by survivalists who want to
conceal their skills, weapons, and goals by blending into their surroundings.
Promoters of gray man style dismiss 'shoot-me-first' tactical gear as a form of
virtue signaling, and instead favor multi-modal dress that will help them avoid
attention until it is time to use force. Some 'gray man directives' include:

if you're a woman: don't arch your back.

The notion of the gray man was developed largely by preppers and survivalists as
a response to a fantasy urban survival scenario. SurvivialThinkTank.com defines
a 'gray man' as 'an individual who possesses the skills, ability and intent to
blend into any situation or surrounding without standing out, concealing his or
her true skills, ability, and intent from others.'

2. The multi-modal nature of grey man.

Phases

The idea of Gray Man Style is that in a "shit hits the fan" scenario, you don't
want to stand out, you want to blend in. But you also want to have the weapons,
tools, and supplies you need to survive. So, one aspect of gray man style is
that it's intensely utilitarian.

Multi-modal

Therefore grey man clothing is often 'transformable' in some way, in order to
swtich between contexts.

3. Where does grey man come from?

Where does the gray man concept come from? Does it come from a three-letter
agency, is it survivalist copypasta, or just common sense? Do people actually
practice gray man?

4. The fashion industry and grey man

When I described the gray man concepts to my friends, most of them immediately
said something along the lines of "so this is normcore for
preppers/racists/republicans". Another friend said that gray man is "weaponized
normcore". And it's true: the abstract footprint of gray man is very similar to
the normcore idea as it was originally defined by K-HOLE[1]. (Note that this
abstract footprint is quite different to how normcore has been implemented by
the fashion and culture industries.) But normcore differs from gray man in one
key respect: the motivation behind each practice. K-HOLE says that normcore is
"a path to a more peaceful life", through the realization that "adaptability
leads to belonging and connection". Some stated motivations behind gray man
include "staying alive", "avoiding kinetic confrontation", and "[staving] the
impending onslaught of self-appointed have-nots". I think many of the
motivations for the development of the gray man idea stem from an urban survival
fantasy scenario. For example, [2]. Dealing with the fact that survival is
socially determined, not individualistic. They want to have their cake, and not
have it be eaten by others.

However, you probably know that normcore in practice has been very different
from K-HOLE's abstract concept. Normcore has a become an immediately
recognizable look that makes hot cool people look even hotter and cooler. I
think that the same sort of process is starting to happen with the gray man
concept. Apparel companies are capturing the power of the grey man idea and
distilling it into a "look". Here's some examples:


What's the % of clothing that is 'tactical'.

Obviously, just from the name, the grey man concept is pretty fucked from a
social justice perspective.
"getting supplies" -> white man's looting

Smells

"Be cognizant of any smells such as food, soap or gunpowder that someone would
relate to something they’d want. Try to think about what you do, say or wear
that may cause a connection to some kind of desire. This is especially important
for females. When SHTF, there will be very few gentlemen and those in power will
take what they want, without regard to repercussions. Be cognizant of innuendo
or movements such as arching your back or physical contact. They may put you in
a situation that you may not be able to get out of."

There’s a theory that a man’s style is just a reiteration of what he wore the
last time he was “really getting laid” — thus the cargo shorts.
