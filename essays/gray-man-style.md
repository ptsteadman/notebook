Headline: What is Gray Man Style?

---

Gray man style is a school of thought developed by survivalists who want to
conceal their skills, weapons, and goals by blending into their surroundings.
Promoters of gray man style dismiss 'shoot-me-first' tactical gear as a form of
virtue signaling, and instead favor multi-modal dress that will help them avoid
attention until it is time to use force. Some 'gray man directives' include:
avoid having a noticeable scent, wear this messenger bag instead of a backpack;
if you're a woman: don't arch your back.

I want to look into:

- Where the term 'gray man' comes from.
- What does gray man style look like? (examples)
- How the fashion industry has adpoted gray man concepts and looks.
- What does gray man style reveal about the people who came up with it?
- Is it possible for non-male, non-white, or queer people to be a gray man?
- How activists and aid workers could use the gray man concept to be more effective.

1. What's the gray man concept?

Gray man style is a school of thought developed by survivalists who want to
conceal their skills, weapons, and goals by blending into their surroundings.
Promoters of gray man style dismiss ostentatious tactical gear as a form of
'shoot-me-first' virtue signaling, and instead favor multi-modal dress that will
help them avoid attention until it is time to use force. Some 'gray man
directives' include: avoid having a noticeable scent, wear a dorky-looking
messenger specially designed for armor plating and fast firearm draws; if you're
a woman: don't arch your back.


SurvivialThinkTank.com defines a 'gray man' as 'an individual who possesses the
skills, ability and intent to blend into any situation or surrounding without
standing out, concealing his or her true skills, ability, and intent from
others.'

"cost you your preps or even your life"

"Be cognizant of any smells such as food, soap or gunpowder that someone would
relate to something they'd want. Try to think about what you do, say or wear
that may cause a connection to some kind of desire. This is especially important
for females. When SHTF, there will be very few gentlemen and those in power will
take what they want, without regard to repercussions. Be cognizant of innuendo
or movements such as arching your back or physical contact. They may put you in
a situation that you may not be able to get out of."

"Ever had a conversation with someone who you’re attracted to and have just one
movement or sentence switch you from being somewhat detached to thinking about
sex?"

2. The multi-modal nature of gray man.

SurvivalThinkTank expands the idea of the gray man to a context-dependent
"directive" broken up into four phases. Each of the four phases corresponds to a
general threat level, from present-day small town Main Street to full on road
warrior situation. For SurvivalThinkTank, the key tradeoff for the gray man is
between Stealth and Firepower/Kit. The transition from phase 0 to phase 3 is
assumed to be inevitable, and as that as society breaks down, carrying firearms
and supplies will be normal, and thus gray. It's also noted that situations can
rapidly escalate.

The idea of Gray Man Style is that in a "shit hits the fan" scenario, you don't
want to stand out, you want to blend in. But you also want to have the weapons,
tools, and supplies you need to survive. So, one aspect of gray man style is
that it's intensely utilitarian.

Multi-modal

Therefore gray man clothing is often 'transformable' in some way, in order to
swtich between contexts.

3. Where does gray man come from?

Where does the gray man concept come from? Does it come from the military, is it
survivalist copypasta, or just common sense? Do people actually practice gray
man? 

The earliest reference I could find online to the concept of the gray man is in
a blogpost on the "Western Rifle Shooters Association" website, alongside
numberous other articles about firearms, survival, and anti-government politics.
This piece, authored by someone called Habcap in a Goofus and Gallant style,
presents gray man as more of an identity than a strategy. Moreover, Habcap
presents gray man as soething that can be practiced in a group: "[The Gray Man]
practices with his weaponry in private, or only with his fellow Grey Men, always
in a secluded location."

Later discussions of the gray man seem to have adapted t largely by
preppers and survivalists as a response to a fantasy urban survival scenario.


4. The fashion industry and gray man

When I described the gray man concepts to my friends, most of them immediately
said something along the lines of "so this is normcore for
preppers/racists/republicans". Another friend said that gray man is "weaponized
normcore". And it's true: the abstract footprint of gray man is very similar to
the normcore idea as it was originally defined by K-HOLE[1]. (Note that this
abstract footprint is quite different to how normcore has been implemented by
the fashion and culture industries.) But normcore differs from gray man in one
key respect: the motivation behind each practice. K-HOLE says that normcore is
"a path to a more peaceful life", through the realization that "adaptability
leads to belonging and connection". Some stated motivations behind gray man
include "staying alive", "avoiding kinetic confrontation", and "[staving] the
impending onslaught of self-appointed have-nots". I think many of the
motivations for the development of the gray man idea stem from an urban survival
fantasy scenario. For example, [2]. Dealing with the fact that survival is
socially determined, not individualistic. They want to have their cake, and not
have it be eaten by others.

However, you probably know that normcore in practice has been very different
from K-HOLE's abstract concept. Normcore has a become an immediately
recognizable look that makes hot cool people look even hotter and cooler. I
think that the same sort of process is starting to happen with the gray man
concept. Apparel companies are capturing the power of the gray man idea and
distilling it into a "look". Here's some examples:

What's the % of clothing that is 'tactical'.


5. Who can be a gray man?

"supply runs" vs looting
Obviously, just from the name, the gray man concept is pretty fucked from a
social justice perspective.
"getting supplies" -> white man's looting

6. The gray rescuer, the gray bloc

If someone asks you "Are you heading to a safe house, do you have someplace safe
to stay?" you can easily respond with "I am looking for [my brother.]" [6]

"Don't play the hero or the villain." [4]

There’s a theory that a man’s style is just a reiteration of what he wore the
last time he was “really getting laid” — thus the cargo shorts.
