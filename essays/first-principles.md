MY FIRST PRINCIPLES OF LITERATURE

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can think of two ways to go about learning literature.  One is to start
from first principles.  We would look at letters, words, events, and figure out
where meaning comes from, and what makes sentences beautiful, and beautiful to
whom.  We would examine a large number of text and non-text documents, and
decide what aspects of these documents are literary.  An idea of what
literature is would appear from these many principles.  We would build the
literature machine in our minds.  We would know how literature works.  And
theoretically this would allow us to create literature with "zen"-like ease
because we know how literature works.

The other approach I can think to learning literature is to hack at it.  This
would mean writing lots of things and trying to get a feel for what works.  And
reading lots of things to understand the bare minimum needed to turn around and
make more literature.  You could try hard and delight when it works, and learn
when it doesn't.  We would remember more and see more.  It would not be boring.

A story is made up of characters.  Characters have sounds and make up words,
and words asdf asdf asdf.  Words needs to be seductive.
Sometimes you have ideas.  They can help.

Examples of ideas that I find interesting:


All words are strings but not all strings are words.  The difference between a
word and a string is that a word will seduce someone, somewhere.

Interesting Sentence Structures:
The Triad: {0} ... {1} ... {2}
I don't know...it may just be that we need to reduce the person we love...so we
can move on.
Allows for the sort of self-qualifying statement that you like.

conversation between two people who are exhorting themselves:
"I haven't done anything good.  My tumblr is just like a diary."
"I need to focus on freelancing work.  My job is making me stupid, my friends
are making me stupid.  All we do is talk about stupid things alll them time."
"All my writing before this last month, after I graduated, is really garbage
I think."
