# Advanced Persistent Threats in the Arts

### Introduction to Advanced Persistent Threats

The term `Advanced Persistent Threat` (APT) was developed by the US Air Force in
2006 to help analysts discuss hacking attacks on civilian organizations without
disclosing the classified identities of the attackers.

(Example of vintage APT activity and how it meets the criteria of an APT.)

(
  Advanced: conversant with the tools and trends of the bleeding edge of the
  trade, allows the APT to engage with sophisticated targets, or remain anonymous
  ?

  Persistent: funded, motivated, protected from the vagaries of business and local
  laws. motivated often by patriotism ?

  Threat: both effective and dangerous to both civilians military. from the
  perspective of an individual: your life can get steamrolled by an APT. from the
  perspective of a government or military: a strategic threat beyond the danger of
  a business or crime organization: threat to homeland security
)

The US government and different information security companies have developed
catalogs of APTs: mappings of names to attack signatures, tools, and suspected
national attribution. The CIA's catalog of APTs was recently leaked, along with
its arsenal of hacking tools.

Browsing the catalog of APTs, one thing jumps out: the vast majority of the APTs
are non-western in attibution. Perhaps this is unsurprising: the term was
invented by the military to cover a type of activity that and group that is
commonly used to attack the US. But, one does wonder, what kind of APTs
originate from NATO countries, and what kind of signatures do they have?

Over the past few years, a lot of light has been shed on the activities of 'The
Equation Group', alternatively known as Longhorn or Lamberts. (Lamberts is the
name given to The Equation Group by Kaspersky , the Russian antivirus and
infosec company...)

The canoncial example of TEG activity is Stuxnet...but there must be more. 

### Theory of Advanced Persistent Threats in the Arts

What relationship do APTs have with arts organizations? Maybe nothing. I don't
want to force comparison between arts groups and APT groups. 

less obviously nefarious...?

- 'long leash' perhaps because of the elevated nature of the pursuit
- the artworld and the hacking world are both very aspirational

Focus on signatures

IRA duh.
Ideally a chinese example.
