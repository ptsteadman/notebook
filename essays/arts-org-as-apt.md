# The Arts Organization as Advanced Persistent Threat

I'm going to do some research about the theory and history of advanced
persistent threats and find arts groups that resemble advanced persistent
threats.

I don't want to force comparison between arts groups and APT groups. It'd be a
shame to try to transfer features between these two different phenomenon. If
anything, I'm motivated by simple curiousity about both types of organizations,
and a desire for intensely effective arts organizations.

APT is non-western

The most obvious similarities are:

- 'long leash' perhaps because of the elevated nature of the pursuit
- the artworld and the hacking world are both very aspirational
