# What Is Ahegao Face and Why Is It Trending?

Pitch:
I'd give a basic overview of Ahegao face and how it's evolved from a hentai
trope to a social media trend.

- Definition: technically "Ahegao Face" is redundant
- Controversy: Belle Deplhine (Belle 19), sexualization of young
  women and girls online, hentai origins of ahegao usually focused on "abnormal
  orgasm" during unwanted or violent sex (it's not the same as normal ikigao or
  "coming face")

Here's my boosette!! -
-also I wanted to address the misinformation about my age! When u Google my age the site 'famous birthdays' comes up first saying I'm 17. I am NOT 17 lol. My birthday is 23rd October 1999 which makes me 19 in 2 weeks! I had to verify my age to be able to post adult content on Patreon. Hope this cleared things up;)

- Similarities to: innocent "challenges" (mannequin challenge, soap challenge,
  etc), duck face + fish gape + smise, instagram / snapchat filters, ...?
- Overview of reactions to ahegao face: disgust, reddit community, "specialists"
  like belle, tik tok users, ahegao clothing
