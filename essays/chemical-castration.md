Pitch: Sexually Frustrated? Consider Chemically Castrating Yourself

Headline: Sexually Frustrated? Consider Chemically Castrating Yourself

In this piece, I will review the medical literature documenting chemical
castration procedures and outcomes (mostly on sex offenders). I will research
the community of men who wish to be chemically castrated for reasons including
life extension, sexual frustration, enlightenment, etc, and the medical
community's response. I will include anecdotal interviews with people who have
been chemical castrated, historical analysis of the roles of eunuchs, and a
discussion of future possibilities.

1. Why and how men are chemically castrated today?
2. Why might a man want to be chemically castrated?
3. What are the health risks and benefits of chemical castration?
4. What are common attitudes towards chemical castration?
5. What has been the historical role of castrated men (eunuchs) in society?
6. What role might voluntarily castrated men play in the future?

Proposed deadline: September 23th

The responses to this Quora user asking if his doctor would give him a chemical
castration seem to represent the typical range of responses: most people suggest
that he sees a therapist or a sex worker, some others point out that sexual
frustration isn't a diagnosable medical indication, and therefore a doctor would
have difficulty prescribing a drug to address it.

It seems strange that society often censures otherwise august public figures
for acting irrationally in pursuit of sex, but then dismisses those who are
interested in reducing or eliminating their own sex drive.

Society might be biased against efforts to reduce sex drive.

One simple issue with prescribing Depo Provera and other drugs to sexually
frustrated men is the risk of side effects. Depo Provera is not prescribed to
young women because of the risk of osteoporosis. Drugs like Cyproterone Acetate
(abbreviated as CPA), sometimes used in hormone therapy for transwomen, are
associated with increased rates of depression, and dangerous side effects like
blood clots.

However, there's also significant scientific evidence that castrated men can
live much longer than men with intact genitals.
