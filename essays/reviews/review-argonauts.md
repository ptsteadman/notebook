I read quickly and found myself enthusiastically highlighting lots of sections, but at the end I felt confused and sort of adrift.

This book has lots of ideas, most obviously the frame metaphor of the Argo, a vessel constantly being rebuilt throughout a long journey. (A metaphor for relationships, political movements, love.) These ideas, some of which are quite slippery, are stated well, and often illustrated with great quotes. At its best, the book handsomely captures facets of most recent sexual, relationship, and political zeitgeists.

Example:

"There’s something truly strange about living in a historical moment in which the conservative anxiety and despair about queers bringing down civilization and its institutions (marriage, most notably) is met by the anxiety and despair so many queers feel about the failure or incapacity of queerness to bring down civilization and its institutions, and their frustration with the assimilationist, unthinkingly neoliberal bent of the mainstream GLBTQ+ movement, which has spent fine coin begging entrance into two historically repressive structures: marriage and the military. “I’m not the kind of faggot who wants to put a rainbow sticker on a machine gun,” declares poet CAConrad. If there’s one thing homonormativity reveals, it’s the troubling fact that you can be victimized and in no way be radical; it happens very often among homosexuals as with every other oppressed minority."

The Argonauts includes other illuminating quotables on femme sexuality, the use of the personal in art, and motherhood (most interestingly some ideas via Donald Winnicot, on how a mother "by taking care of her infant, even before the child is old enough to speak, teaches it that life is worth living".) Some of these ideas, like the idea that you can be victimized without being radical, have already permeated into pop culture (or at least the part of it that I'm in.) Sometimes this is great (it's refreshing to see an idea explained clearly, instead of sloppily alluded to in tweets), and sometimes it's a bit boring (other reviewers have noted that Nelson seems to be a bit stuck in the 90s in her expectations of what readers will find surprising.) 

I think that "The Argonauts" ultimately lacks a thesis on motherhood / childbirth. Given the critical theory-like nature of the text, I was expecting some sort of theory of queer motherhood, or an intellectual/emotional journey on the part of the narrator. However, to borrow Nelson's Argo metaphor, it seems like the ship is being reassembled without actually going anywhere.
