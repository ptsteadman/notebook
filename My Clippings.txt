why do people hate listening to dreams? i used to hate it too. at some point i started thinking ‘it’s not any less real than being awake, you’re ‘hating’ for irrational reasons. ’ 8:18 - 8:30PM: talked with colin on phone. i will make a copy of my application and send tomorrow. seems strange to do this, like.hm. you probably get why it’s strange.8:30-11:15PM: talked with mom. MOM CONVERSATION HIGHLIGHTS: -telling me she referred to a period of her life where she was mostly miserable and the only hope was that it would end by dying ‘the abyss. ’ she said ‘i thought i was in hell and my dad was the devil, i really believed that was happening. ’ she thought this every day but never told anyone. i said ‘i feel like i’m in hell right now but dad’s okay. ’ 193

In the month I’ve been doing this, no one has called me out on how self-absorbed/obsessed I am, how I’m not intelligent or cultured, how I’m not contributing anything to society, how it’s weird that my lifestyle is to rarely sleep and talk almost exclusively to my parents, who I also live with, how irresponsible I am about my physical and mental health and how drugs are bad and I’m addicted, how I contradict myself (can’t think of examples but I’m sure I do it), how my ‘voice’ is just the combination of like five clearer stronger ‘voices’ I like I don’t know whether to say ‘thank you’ or People just like it when I’m funny or insightful246

And also defined by being on a lake that is warm and calm and has a dock and some boats and jetskis to ride around in. When you ride one of these things you have no where to go and no purpose besides having some fun. It's the same sort of excess where you can start drinking beer at 11am. And a hammock and a chaise lounge that you can alternate between lying on. And the most beautiful sunsets. For dinner you can eat steak and grilled corn and drink nice red wine and eat apple strudels heated on the barbecue with 10 year old cheddar melted on it. This all actually happened, I almost wish I could make it up, because then I would be capable of even imagining something so nice. Instead things this nice only really come along through piecemeal happenstance.

The whole idea is that being a NEET is about setting your range of expectations and basically defining the scope of your world. So you think “I will play Senran Kagura and I hope to unlock some new exciting outfits!”. You don't know what the outfits will be, sure, but there is no outfit that will fall outside your scope. Or like “I will look at some posts on /jp/”, that's a good example. 99% of the time there's no posts that will fall outside of that scope. But sometime there are, and Janny won't get to them quick enough, and then that's an externality. Do you get it?

instead of selling me a refurbished used computer. He said ‘machine. ’ I like it when computer people call computers ‘machines’ instead. Got a little turned on writing that, imagining the mind of a computer person, feeling insecure that computers aren’t as ‘machine-y’ as other machines like cars but they’re technically still machines. Seems sexy, frail. Frail and knowable. I would say ‘I’d like to see the machine’ when I pick up repaired computer, then he’d retrieve it from the back (I’d let him retrieve it to increase waiting time so there could be a bigger-feeling reward, because I too am looking out for his best value) then I’d take it from him and set it aside without breaking eye contact and say, ‘I’d like to see the other machine, the one in the back,’ moving closer and just…Jesus lol…grabbing his button-down where it meets the pants. Pulling it out. Right on the button line. I would be pulling from the button line, because it’s like a little handle. Zoom in for a close inspection of the freckle/mole face area. Check to see if that shit needs refurbishing. Refurbish the shit out of that face mole cluster thingy. I think it’s near his eye. Give him a nice him a nice hot quote on that mole cluster, try to get him a good deal, I’ll check online to make sure my deal is the best. Then I’ll call him on Monday, the full refurbishments will have to wait until Monday, because I want to make sure I have ordered and stocked the very best parts. The waiting will increase the reward, also. Forgot I was trying to describe how I froze up around him. It was because of thinking something like that while he was in the back room, expecting he would return ‘less attractive. ’ That face mole thingy though.Hoo. Some real Achilles’ heel type shit, me and face moles. IT’S LIKE HOW DO THEY EVEN GET THERE ON THE FACE, HOW COULD A FACE PRODUCE SUCH A MARVEL, HOW COULD IT KNOW TO GENERATE SUCH A PERFECTLY SHAPED USELESS THING IN THE MIDST OF THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF SENSORY 319

Critics use the term narcissism so loosely that it retains little of its psychological content. They confuse cause and effect. When using the word narcissism as critique, they smell of ideology. In their loosest meaning of the word, they can also mean their own motivated perception of selfishness or self indulgence.

29PM: pictured myself looking ‘calmly dead’ in bed, getting found by mark probably, after transferring all my paypal money (~$350) to my savings account (~$100), spending it all on heroin to combine with all the xanax i have (~20mg) and a bottle of wine. mark would say ‘ah jeez. that’s too bad’ and call whoever you call. that’s if i find out i’m pregnant. i would make sure my cats had enough food for a few days before i did it. i don’t know if i’d leave a note. my note would be an asterisk and my last liveblog update would be ‘* : see above. ’ 2:55PM: chewed caffeine pill with teeth and swallowed. ate noopept. the DMV is 26 minutes away. i think i got this. i can do this today. decided ‘lacking interest in food’ depression is better than the alternative, for health459

chris killen thing marathon style.~4700 words. great job shitty shoo.10:44PM: it’s 10:44PM now. just so you.know. i’m addressing that the beginning of the ending of this break ends at ‘10:44PM:’ so that probably means right now it is 10:44PM, i think you know that, addressing it now though.officially. going to resume transcribing chris’ thing 11:05PM. everything i remember doing from 9:02-10:44PM: -went to pickles and pies to get more energy drinks/groceries/cat food. talked to myself in ‘chris voice’ while dressing. emailed tao to see if i was taking too long on transcription/if there were money issues.-recorded video of me talking like chris but seems unseemly.-drank remaining liquid in sugar-free red bull can.-saw matthew donahoo text from 7:28PM, picture captioned with ‘My roommate is making grunting sounds while I look at him from the couch’ -started typing response to mira’s text from earlier thinking ‘this will not garner a response but i want to respond more. ’ -approached colin and ‘fancy food friend’ on the way to pickles and pies. seemed like we might not talk but then i said ‘hi. ’ he asked where i was going. i said ‘oh just pickles and pies. ’ he said ‘word. ’ we had already passed each other, i was standing and had turned around to face colin and friend as they continued walking to apartment building. colin said i missed something on saturday, the irish music festival thing. he said ‘my texts. ’ i was holding my phone. i said ‘i dropped my phone’ or something.embarrassed. he said ‘feel free to stop by on your way back, we’re just hanging out. ’ there was a moment. i said ‘have a good night. ’ seemed…obvious…that 478

looked at face/pupils in mirror. pupils big. pictured myself saying ‘hi guys, i’m working on this thing all day and night, transcribing this thing’ and eventually saying the word ‘gig’ and pee running down legs.-ate an amount of vyvanse, think it’s 25mg. it’s the one masha drew something on, i think, to indicate it contained less. texted masha a response thinking ‘this will not garner a response but i want to respond to people more. ’ -willis texted if i’d be home/at rockaway tomorrow and…i thought today was tuesday and tao’s reading was tomorrow and mira’s/scott’s/my baltimore reading was the next day.relieved. i said i might be sleeping during the day probably.11:15PM: drinking monster drink. don’t like typing ‘monster’ ever.ever.EVER.now, especially. shirley on the bed. both windows open. they don’t let you do it in my building after 10PM. it’s okay. it’s okay. when i started typing this i felt insane…abberant…very not-normal lifestyle, very alone, very ‘what am i pretending i know how to do, will it help to call mom?’ lit candles. have been texting with matthew a little and feeling better. back muscles tense. whole back of body. stomach muscles also, like i’ve been exercising. can tell elbows/arms are tensed when i type.headache. chest tightness stuff.okay. chewing trident gum. it is a spearment flavored. i’m leaving it typed like that, that’s what it sounded like in my head. NO BUTTS ABOUT IT. no butts. resuming transcribing at 12:05AM. maybe if i liveblog long enough i’ll eventually become consistent about saying ‘AM/PM’ all of the time or none of the time and figure out what i want ‘number consistency: below 10 = spelled? not? when not?’ and things like that.so. stay tuned for that. that’s right, ‘stay. ’ instructing you to ‘stay’ something, which means…assuming you are already something…‘tuned,’ in this case…instructing you to continue doing what you’re doing, if what you’re doing is what i think you’re doing.okay. just so we’re clear480

zero interest in psychotherapy, zero insight, on the surface all the time’ (dad repeated those phrases maybe three times each during monologue, all context points from previous recurring arguments we’ve had re: me not wanting to do therapy and not liking it, after having tried therapy and it not seeming to work). He said Ted was depressed and wouldn’t leave bed for six months and his son who was three or four years old would walk by his room and say ‘mom, is daddy seeping?’ I said ‘Ted sounds sad. ’ dad said something about how Ted was depressed but didn’t have feelings. I said ‘it feels bad to feel depressed, to have no feelings, I think depression is a feeling. ’ then dad said the ‘zero insight’ things. He and Ted were childhood friends and dad won’t talk to him anymore because Ted got dad and his friends to invest in real estate before shit hit the fan ~2008. Dad thinks Ted is hoarding all their money because he won’t return phone calls. I don’t return phone calls either. That was another thing dad kept repeating, to emphasize Ted’s shittiness: ‘he never returns my calls. ’

That she was dependent on him, and on him alone, even though she might receive orders from persons other than himself, whether he was present or absent, for as a matter of principle he was participating in whatever might be demanded of or inflicted on her, and that it was he who possessed and enjoyed her through those into whose hands she had been given, by the simple fact that he had given her to them. She must greet them and submit to them with the same respect with which she greeted him, as though they were so many reflections of him. Thus he would possess her as a god possesses his creatures, whom he lays hold of in the guise of a monster or a bird, of an invisible spirit or a state of ecstasy.

After the Alma intersection, the Cours la Reine was visible because the trees were bare, and the Place de la Concorde sparkling and dry with, above it, the sort of sky which promises snow, but from which snow has not yet fallen. O heard a little click and felt the warm air rising around her legs: Sir Stephen had turned on the heater.

In the same vein, she would not tolerate not paying whenever they had tea together in some pastry shop. She would kiss her hand and, if she had a chance, her mouth, if possible in the street. But these were so many affectations she paraded for the sake of scandal, displayed much more from childishness than from conviction. On the other hand, her penchant for the sweetness of sweetly made-up lips yielding beneath her own, for the procelain or pearly sparkle of eyes half-closed in the half-light of couches at five in the afternoon, when the curtains are drawn and the lamp on the fireplace mantel lighted, for the voices that say: “Again, oh, please, again …,” for the marine odor clinging to her fingers: this was a real, deeply-rooted taste. And she also enjoyed the pursuit just as much. Probably not for the pursuit itself, however amusing or fascinating it might be, but for the complete sense of freedom she experienced in the act of hunting.

The pleasure she derived from seeing a girl pant beneath her caresses, seeing her eyes close and the tips of her breasts stiffen beneath her lips and teeth, the pleasure she got from exploring her fore and aft with her hand—and from feeling her tighten around her fingers, then sigh and moan—was more than she could bear; and if this pleasure was so intense, it was only because it made her constantly aware of the pleasure which she in turn gave when she tightened around whoever was holding her, whenever she sighed or moaned, with this difference, that she could not conceive of being given thus to a girl, the way this girl was given to her, but only to a man.

Trust had to be won from zero at every encounter. That’s the reason you always see women being so effusive with each other—crying out shrilly upon recognizing each other in the street. Women always have to confirm with each other, even after so many years: We are still all right. But in the exaggeration of their effusiveness, you know that things are not all right between them, and that they never will be.

For so long I had been looking hard into every person I met, hoping I might discover in them all the thoughts and feelings I hoped life would give me, but hadn’t. There are some people who say you have to find such things in yourself, that you cannot count on anyone to supply even the smallest crumb that your life lacks. Although I knew this might be true, it didn’t prevent me from looking anyway. Who cares what people say? What people say has no effect on your heart.

Just as the Argo’s parts may be replaced over time but the boat is still called the Argo, whenever the lover utters the phrase “I love you,” its meaning must be renewed by each use, as “the very task of love and of language is to give to one and the same phrase inflections which will be forever new.”

The answer isn’t just to introduce new words (boi, cisgendered, andro-fag) and then set out to reify their meanings (though obviously there is power and pragmatism here). One must also become alert to the multitude of possible uses, possible contexts, the wings with which each word can fly. Like when you whisper, You’re just a hole, letting me fill you up.

“Calling an interest in Poussin nostalgic or elitist is like calling the interest one has, say, in the person one cares for most deeply ‘hetero- (or homo-) sexist,’ or ‘exclusive’ or ‘proprietorial.’ Yes, that may be right: those may be roughly the parameters, and regrettable; but the interest itself may still be more complete and human—still carry more of human possibility and compassion—than interests uncontaminated by any such affect or compulsion.”

Perhaps this is why psychologist D. W. Winnicott’s notion of “feeling real” is so moving to me. One can aspire to feel real, one can help others to feel real, and one can oneself feel real—a feeling Winnicott describes as the collected, primary sensation of aliveness, “the aliveness of the body tissues and working of body-functions, including the heart’s action and breathing,” which makes spontaneous gesture possible. For Winnicott, feeling real is not reactive to external stimuli, nor is it an identity. It is a sensation—a sensation that spreads. Among other things, it makes one want to live.

There’s something truly strange about living in a historical moment in which the conservative anxiety and despair about queers bringing down civilization and its institutions (marriage, most notably) is met by the anxiety and despair so many queers feel about the failure or incapacity of queerness to bring down civilization and its institutions, and their frustration with the assimilationist, unthinkingly neoliberal bent of the mainstream GLBTQ+ movement, which has spent fine coin begging entrance into two historically repressive structures: marriage and the military. “I’m not the kind of faggot who wants to put a rainbow sticker on a machine gun,” declares poet CAConrad. If there’s one thing homonormativity reveals, it’s the troubling fact that you can be victimized and in no way be radical; it happens very often among homosexuals as with every other oppressed minority.

And yet, at the same time, it feels disingenuous of me not to acknowledge that on a literal level, having a small body, a slender body, has long been related to my sense of self, even my sense of freedom.

We each anguished differently and severely: you wanted to give her the care she’d once given to you, but could see it was breaking our new household to try; she was sick and broke and terrified, utterly unwilling or unable to discuss her condition or her options. Eventually I, villainous, drew a line; I couldn’t live this way. She chose to go back to her condo in the suburbs of Detroit and decline alone rather than accept the substandard care of a Medicaid facility near us—all her assets liquidated, a TV blaring from behind a neighbor’s canvas curtain, nurses whispering about accepting Christ as your personal savior, you know the place.

Most people live their entire lives with their clothes on, and even if they wanted to, couldn’t take them off. Then there are those who cannot put them on. They are the ones who live their lives not just as people but as examples of people. They are destined to expose every part of themselves, so the rest of us can know what it means to be a human. Most people lead their private lives. They have been given a natural modesty that feels to them like morality, but it’s not—it’s luck. They shake their heads at the people with their clothes off rather than learning about human life from their example, but they are wrong to act so superior. Some of us have to be naked, so the rest can be exempted by fate.

I felt like I could just close my eyes and go to sleep on that mattress forever. There were no chairs, so I sat down on the messy sheets and watched him move around the room, then leave for the bathroom, then come back, showered and changed, coked up, his shirt open and untucked.

Or it’s like in The Little Prince—when the prince asks the narrator to draw him a sheep. The narrator tries and tries again, but each time he fails to do it as well as he wishes. He believes himself to be a great artist and cannot understand why it’s not working. In a fit of frustration, he instead draws a box—something he can do well. When the prince asks how it’s a picture of a sheep, the narrator replies that it’s a picture of a sheep in a box. He is arrogantly proud of his solution and satisfied with his efforts. This response is typical of all puers. Such people will suddenly tell you they have another plan, and they always do it the moment things start getting difficult. But it’s their everlasting switching that’s the dangerous thing, not what they choose.

Now she explained, touching its sides, “I wanted to call it The Genius but instead I’m calling it House for a Head. I don’t believe enough in genius, but I do believe in having a house for a head.” I almost cried. I didn’t want to say it, but I felt pretty crummy at being demoted from genius to simply having a house for a head.

SHEILA So the point here is not to decide who’s the greatest artist? MARGAUX Not at all. Not at all. But it is a chance to let the younger artists in. It is a chance to let the smaller galleries in. I don’t know what it is. It’s not everything. SHEILA If you think that going to an art fair and having your pictures in a booth will make you famous, it won’t. MARGAUX But no one’s thinking that at all! SHEILA Hmm. I would be thinking that if I was an artist here.

Any person who accepts a life of low bodily pleasure and poor affect, even if he does so for beneficent reasons, is failing to contribute to group learning about pleasure, and failing to contribute to a cartel in which humans demand a floor level of bodily well-being – in a sense, scabbing against humanity.
