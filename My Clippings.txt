why do people hate listening to dreams? i used to hate it too. at some point i started thinking ‘it’s not any less real than being awake, you’re ‘hating’ for irrational reasons. ’ 8:18 - 8:30PM: talked with colin on phone. i will make a copy of my application and send tomorrow. seems strange to do this, like.hm. you probably get why it’s strange.8:30-11:15PM: talked with mom. MOM CONVERSATION HIGHLIGHTS: -telling me she referred to a period of her life where she was mostly miserable and the only hope was that it would end by dying ‘the abyss. ’ she said ‘i thought i was in hell and my dad was the devil, i really believed that was happening. ’ she thought this every day but never told anyone. i said ‘i feel like i’m in hell right now but dad’s okay. ’ 193

In the month I’ve been doing this, no one has called me out on how self-absorbed/obsessed I am, how I’m not intelligent or cultured, how I’m not contributing anything to society, how it’s weird that my lifestyle is to rarely sleep and talk almost exclusively to my parents, who I also live with, how irresponsible I am about my physical and mental health and how drugs are bad and I’m addicted, how I contradict myself (can’t think of examples but I’m sure I do it), how my ‘voice’ is just the combination of like five clearer stronger ‘voices’ I like I don’t know whether to say ‘thank you’ or People just like it when I’m funny or insightful246

And also defined by being on a lake that is warm and calm and has a dock and some boats and jetskis to ride around in. When you ride one of these things you have no where to go and no purpose besides having some fun. It's the same sort of excess where you can start drinking beer at 11am. And a hammock and a chaise lounge that you can alternate between lying on. And the most beautiful sunsets. For dinner you can eat steak and grilled corn and drink nice red wine and eat apple strudels heated on the barbecue with 10 year old cheddar melted on it. This all actually happened, I almost wish I could make it up, because then I would be capable of even imagining something so nice. Instead things this nice only really come along through piecemeal happenstance.

The whole idea is that being a NEET is about setting your range of expectations and basically defining the scope of your world. So you think “I will play Senran Kagura and I hope to unlock some new exciting outfits!”. You don't know what the outfits will be, sure, but there is no outfit that will fall outside your scope. Or like “I will look at some posts on /jp/”, that's a good example. 99% of the time there's no posts that will fall outside of that scope. But sometime there are, and Janny won't get to them quick enough, and then that's an externality. Do you get it?

instead of selling me a refurbished used computer. He said ‘machine. ’ I like it when computer people call computers ‘machines’ instead. Got a little turned on writing that, imagining the mind of a computer person, feeling insecure that computers aren’t as ‘machine-y’ as other machines like cars but they’re technically still machines. Seems sexy, frail. Frail and knowable. I would say ‘I’d like to see the machine’ when I pick up repaired computer, then he’d retrieve it from the back (I’d let him retrieve it to increase waiting time so there could be a bigger-feeling reward, because I too am looking out for his best value) then I’d take it from him and set it aside without breaking eye contact and say, ‘I’d like to see the other machine, the one in the back,’ moving closer and just…Jesus lol…grabbing his button-down where it meets the pants. Pulling it out. Right on the button line. I would be pulling from the button line, because it’s like a little handle. Zoom in for a close inspection of the freckle/mole face area. Check to see if that shit needs refurbishing. Refurbish the shit out of that face mole cluster thingy. I think it’s near his eye. Give him a nice him a nice hot quote on that mole cluster, try to get him a good deal, I’ll check online to make sure my deal is the best. Then I’ll call him on Monday, the full refurbishments will have to wait until Monday, because I want to make sure I have ordered and stocked the very best parts. The waiting will increase the reward, also. Forgot I was trying to describe how I froze up around him. It was because of thinking something like that while he was in the back room, expecting he would return ‘less attractive. ’ That face mole thingy though.Hoo. Some real Achilles’ heel type shit, me and face moles. IT’S LIKE HOW DO THEY EVEN GET THERE ON THE FACE, HOW COULD A FACE PRODUCE SUCH A MARVEL, HOW COULD IT KNOW TO GENERATE SUCH A PERFECTLY SHAPED USELESS THING IN THE MIDST OF THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF SENSORY 319

Critics use the term narcissism so loosely that it retains little of its psychological content. They confuse cause and effect. When using the word narcissism as critique, they smell of ideology. In their loosest meaning of the word, they can also mean their own motivated perception of selfishness or self indulgence.

29PM: pictured myself looking ‘calmly dead’ in bed, getting found by mark probably, after transferring all my paypal money (~$350) to my savings account (~$100), spending it all on heroin to combine with all the xanax i have (~20mg) and a bottle of wine. mark would say ‘ah jeez. that’s too bad’ and call whoever you call. that’s if i find out i’m pregnant. i would make sure my cats had enough food for a few days before i did it. i don’t know if i’d leave a note. my note would be an asterisk and my last liveblog update would be ‘* : see above. ’ 2:55PM: chewed caffeine pill with teeth and swallowed. ate noopept. the DMV is 26 minutes away. i think i got this. i can do this today. decided ‘lacking interest in food’ depression is better than the alternative, for health459

chris killen thing marathon style.~4700 words. great job shitty shoo.10:44PM: it’s 10:44PM now. just so you.know. i’m addressing that the beginning of the ending of this break ends at ‘10:44PM:’ so that probably means right now it is 10:44PM, i think you know that, addressing it now though.officially. going to resume transcribing chris’ thing 11:05PM. everything i remember doing from 9:02-10:44PM: -went to pickles and pies to get more energy drinks/groceries/cat food. talked to myself in ‘chris voice’ while dressing. emailed tao to see if i was taking too long on transcription/if there were money issues.-recorded video of me talking like chris but seems unseemly.-drank remaining liquid in sugar-free red bull can.-saw matthew donahoo text from 7:28PM, picture captioned with ‘My roommate is making grunting sounds while I look at him from the couch’ -started typing response to mira’s text from earlier thinking ‘this will not garner a response but i want to respond more. ’ -approached colin and ‘fancy food friend’ on the way to pickles and pies. seemed like we might not talk but then i said ‘hi. ’ he asked where i was going. i said ‘oh just pickles and pies. ’ he said ‘word. ’ we had already passed each other, i was standing and had turned around to face colin and friend as they continued walking to apartment building. colin said i missed something on saturday, the irish music festival thing. he said ‘my texts. ’ i was holding my phone. i said ‘i dropped my phone’ or something.embarrassed. he said ‘feel free to stop by on your way back, we’re just hanging out. ’ there was a moment. i said ‘have a good night. ’ seemed…obvious…that 478

looked at face/pupils in mirror. pupils big. pictured myself saying ‘hi guys, i’m working on this thing all day and night, transcribing this thing’ and eventually saying the word ‘gig’ and pee running down legs.-ate an amount of vyvanse, think it’s 25mg. it’s the one masha drew something on, i think, to indicate it contained less. texted masha a response thinking ‘this will not garner a response but i want to respond to people more. ’ -willis texted if i’d be home/at rockaway tomorrow and…i thought today was tuesday and tao’s reading was tomorrow and mira’s/scott’s/my baltimore reading was the next day.relieved. i said i might be sleeping during the day probably.11:15PM: drinking monster drink. don’t like typing ‘monster’ ever.ever.EVER.now, especially. shirley on the bed. both windows open. they don’t let you do it in my building after 10PM. it’s okay. it’s okay. when i started typing this i felt insane…abberant…very not-normal lifestyle, very alone, very ‘what am i pretending i know how to do, will it help to call mom?’ lit candles. have been texting with matthew a little and feeling better. back muscles tense. whole back of body. stomach muscles also, like i’ve been exercising. can tell elbows/arms are tensed when i type.headache. chest tightness stuff.okay. chewing trident gum. it is a spearment flavored. i’m leaving it typed like that, that’s what it sounded like in my head. NO BUTTS ABOUT IT. no butts. resuming transcribing at 12:05AM. maybe if i liveblog long enough i’ll eventually become consistent about saying ‘AM/PM’ all of the time or none of the time and figure out what i want ‘number consistency: below 10 = spelled? not? when not?’ and things like that.so. stay tuned for that. that’s right, ‘stay. ’ instructing you to ‘stay’ something, which means…assuming you are already something…‘tuned,’ in this case…instructing you to continue doing what you’re doing, if what you’re doing is what i think you’re doing.okay. just so we’re clear480

zero interest in psychotherapy, zero insight, on the surface all the time’ (dad repeated those phrases maybe three times each during monologue, all context points from previous recurring arguments we’ve had re: me not wanting to do therapy and not liking it, after having tried therapy and it not seeming to work). He said Ted was depressed and wouldn’t leave bed for six months and his son who was three or four years old would walk by his room and say ‘mom, is daddy seeping?’ I said ‘Ted sounds sad. ’ dad said something about how Ted was depressed but didn’t have feelings. I said ‘it feels bad to feel depressed, to have no feelings, I think depression is a feeling. ’ then dad said the ‘zero insight’ things. He and Ted were childhood friends and dad won’t talk to him anymore because Ted got dad and his friends to invest in real estate before shit hit the fan ~2008. Dad thinks Ted is hoarding all their money because he won’t return phone calls. I don’t return phone calls either. That was another thing dad kept repeating, to emphasize Ted’s shittiness: ‘he never returns my calls. ’

That she was dependent on him, and on him alone, even though she might receive orders from persons other than himself, whether he was present or absent, for as a matter of principle he was participating in whatever might be demanded of or inflicted on her, and that it was he who possessed and enjoyed her through those into whose hands she had been given, by the simple fact that he had given her to them. She must greet them and submit to them with the same respect with which she greeted him, as though they were so many reflections of him. Thus he would possess her as a god possesses his creatures, whom he lays hold of in the guise of a monster or a bird, of an invisible spirit or a state of ecstasy.

After the Alma intersection, the Cours la Reine was visible because the trees were bare, and the Place de la Concorde sparkling and dry with, above it, the sort of sky which promises snow, but from which snow has not yet fallen. O heard a little click and felt the warm air rising around her legs: Sir Stephen had turned on the heater.

In the same vein, she would not tolerate not paying whenever they had tea together in some pastry shop. She would kiss her hand and, if she had a chance, her mouth, if possible in the street. But these were so many affectations she paraded for the sake of scandal, displayed much more from childishness than from conviction. On the other hand, her penchant for the sweetness of sweetly made-up lips yielding beneath her own, for the procelain or pearly sparkle of eyes half-closed in the half-light of couches at five in the afternoon, when the curtains are drawn and the lamp on the fireplace mantel lighted, for the voices that say: “Again, oh, please, again …,” for the marine odor clinging to her fingers: this was a real, deeply-rooted taste. And she also enjoyed the pursuit just as much. Probably not for the pursuit itself, however amusing or fascinating it might be, but for the complete sense of freedom she experienced in the act of hunting.

The pleasure she derived from seeing a girl pant beneath her caresses, seeing her eyes close and the tips of her breasts stiffen beneath her lips and teeth, the pleasure she got from exploring her fore and aft with her hand—and from feeling her tighten around her fingers, then sigh and moan—was more than she could bear; and if this pleasure was so intense, it was only because it made her constantly aware of the pleasure which she in turn gave when she tightened around whoever was holding her, whenever she sighed or moaned, with this difference, that she could not conceive of being given thus to a girl, the way this girl was given to her, but only to a man.

Trust had to be won from zero at every encounter. That’s the reason you always see women being so effusive with each other—crying out shrilly upon recognizing each other in the street. Women always have to confirm with each other, even after so many years: We are still all right. But in the exaggeration of their effusiveness, you know that things are not all right between them, and that they never will be.

For so long I had been looking hard into every person I met, hoping I might discover in them all the thoughts and feelings I hoped life would give me, but hadn’t. There are some people who say you have to find such things in yourself, that you cannot count on anyone to supply even the smallest crumb that your life lacks. Although I knew this might be true, it didn’t prevent me from looking anyway. Who cares what people say? What people say has no effect on your heart.

Just as the Argo’s parts may be replaced over time but the boat is still called the Argo, whenever the lover utters the phrase “I love you,” its meaning must be renewed by each use, as “the very task of love and of language is to give to one and the same phrase inflections which will be forever new.”

The answer isn’t just to introduce new words (boi, cisgendered, andro-fag) and then set out to reify their meanings (though obviously there is power and pragmatism here). One must also become alert to the multitude of possible uses, possible contexts, the wings with which each word can fly. Like when you whisper, You’re just a hole, letting me fill you up.

“Calling an interest in Poussin nostalgic or elitist is like calling the interest one has, say, in the person one cares for most deeply ‘hetero- (or homo-) sexist,’ or ‘exclusive’ or ‘proprietorial.’ Yes, that may be right: those may be roughly the parameters, and regrettable; but the interest itself may still be more complete and human—still carry more of human possibility and compassion—than interests uncontaminated by any such affect or compulsion.”

Perhaps this is why psychologist D. W. Winnicott’s notion of “feeling real” is so moving to me. One can aspire to feel real, one can help others to feel real, and one can oneself feel real—a feeling Winnicott describes as the collected, primary sensation of aliveness, “the aliveness of the body tissues and working of body-functions, including the heart’s action and breathing,” which makes spontaneous gesture possible. For Winnicott, feeling real is not reactive to external stimuli, nor is it an identity. It is a sensation—a sensation that spreads. Among other things, it makes one want to live.

There’s something truly strange about living in a historical moment in which the conservative anxiety and despair about queers bringing down civilization and its institutions (marriage, most notably) is met by the anxiety and despair so many queers feel about the failure or incapacity of queerness to bring down civilization and its institutions, and their frustration with the assimilationist, unthinkingly neoliberal bent of the mainstream GLBTQ+ movement, which has spent fine coin begging entrance into two historically repressive structures: marriage and the military. “I’m not the kind of faggot who wants to put a rainbow sticker on a machine gun,” declares poet CAConrad. If there’s one thing homonormativity reveals, it’s the troubling fact that you can be victimized and in no way be radical; it happens very often among homosexuals as with every other oppressed minority.

We each anguished differently and severely: you wanted to give her the care she’d once given to you, but could see it was breaking our new household to try; she was sick and broke and terrified, utterly unwilling or unable to discuss her condition or her options. Eventually I, villainous, drew a line; I couldn’t live this way. She chose to go back to her condo in the suburbs of Detroit and decline alone rather than accept the substandard care of a Medicaid facility near us—all her assets liquidated, a TV blaring from behind a neighbor’s canvas curtain, nurses whispering about accepting Christ as your personal savior, you know the place.

Most people live their entire lives with their clothes on, and even if they wanted to, couldn’t take them off. Then there are those who cannot put them on. They are the ones who live their lives not just as people but as examples of people. They are destined to expose every part of themselves, so the rest of us can know what it means to be a human. Most people lead their private lives. They have been given a natural modesty that feels to them like morality, but it’s not—it’s luck. They shake their heads at the people with their clothes off rather than learning about human life from their example, but they are wrong to act so superior. Some of us have to be naked, so the rest can be exempted by fate.

Or it’s like in The Little Prince—when the prince asks the narrator to draw him a sheep. The narrator tries and tries again, but each time he fails to do it as well as he wishes. He believes himself to be a great artist and cannot understand why it’s not working. In a fit of frustration, he instead draws a box—something he can do well. When the prince asks how it’s a picture of a sheep, the narrator replies that it’s a picture of a sheep in a box. He is arrogantly proud of his solution and satisfied with his efforts. This response is typical of all puers. Such people will suddenly tell you they have another plan, and they always do it the moment things start getting difficult. But it’s their everlasting switching that’s the dangerous thing, not what they choose.

However, the prejudice against the use of consciousness-opening plants and drugs has the major part of its origin in racial intolerance and the accumulation of political power. In the latter part of the last century, once the Intercontinental Railway had been built and the Chinese laborers were no longer needed, they were increasingly portrayed as subhuman and uncivilized; they were yellow-skinned, slant-eyed, dangerous aliens who frequented opium dens. Peyote was described, in various publications of the late 19th century, as the cause of murder, mayhem and insanity among the shiftless Ameri- can Indians.

Milgrim, who hadn’t heard Russian since leaving Basel, felt a peculiar enchantment, in spite of the sullen presence of their guard, and the handrail in his back. The elevator stopped, the door opened, and a tall Parisian teenager stepped in. As the door closed, Milgrim noted the guard’s focus on the girl, no less sullen but absolute. Slender, brunette, she looked from Milgrim to the two Russian women with a sort of benign disdain, ignoring the guard.

“It’s not about being cool,” I told him. “It’s about just being. De Niro was just being; I can never do that now.” Greg stopped in the middle of the pavement and turned to face me. “Do you think you could before?” he asked. “Do you think I can? Do you think that anyone outside of films lights cigarettes or opens fridge doors like that? Think about it: the lighter doesn’t spark first time you flip it, the first wisp of smoke gets in your eye and makes you wince; the fridge door catches and then rattles, milk slops over. It happens to everyone. It’s universal: everything fucks up! You’re not unusual. You know what you are?” “No,” I said. “What?” “You’re just more usual than everyone else.” I thought about that for a long time afterwards, that conversation. I decided Greg was right. I’d always been inauthentic. Even before the accident, if I’d been walking down the street just like De Niro, smoking a cigarette like him, and even if it had lit first try, I’d still be thinking: Here I am, walking down the street, smoking a cigarette, like someone in a film.

During lessons at our college, however, students will be found slumped on desk, talking almost constantly, snacking incessantly (or even, on occasions, eating full meals). The old disciplinary segmentation of time is breaking down. The carceral regime of discipline is being eroded by the technologies of control, with their systems of perpetual consumption and continuous development.

It demands leaps of faith, but it rewards the believer with a sense of consequence. Moreover, just as churches and other ritualistic meeting places serve a social function, so art events generate a sense of community around shared interests. Eric Banks, a writer-editor who appears in Chapter 5, argues that the fervent sociality of the art world has unexpected benefits. “People really do talk about the art they see,” he said. “If I’m reading something by, say, Roberto Bolaño, I’ll find very few people to discuss it with. Reading takes a long time and it’s solitary, whereas art fosters quick-forming imagined communities.”

as "primary repression" means precisely that: it is not a "countercathexis," but rather this repulsion of desiring-machines by the body without organs. This is the real meaning of the paranoiac machine: the desiring-machines attempt to break into the body without organs, and the body without organs repels them, since it experiences them as an over-all persecution apparatus. Thus we cannot agree with Victor Tausk when he regards the paranoiac machine as a mere projection of."a ~erson's.own bodY~' and the genital organs. " The genesis of the machine lies precisely here

Some may wonder how Navy SEAL combat leadership principles translate outside the military realm to leading any team in any capacity. But combat is reflective of life, only amplified and intensified. Decisions have immediate consequences, and everything—absolutely everything—is at stake. The right decision, even when all seems lost, can snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. The wrong decision, even when a victorious outcome seems all but certain, can result in deadly, catastrophic failure. In that regard, a combat leader can acquire a lifetime of leadership lessons learned in only a few deployments.

Hedge-fund managers are relatively new arrivals to the art world, so some worry that they might be acquiring art as if it were stock in order to turn a profit. Others argue that they’re above it; hardworking billionaires have no need to make a few million on art. “What starts them collecting is a curiosity for a life fully lived,” says Heller. “And nowadays, in America, it’s what you do if you have money, just like it has been for decades for Europeans.”

Yet there is nothing very remarkable about these characters. Turgenev complained that they were all mediocrities, and in a sense he was right. They are ordinary men and women.

Modern art wanted to purify the image of everything exterior to it, to render the image autonomous and self-suffcient—but in so doing only affrmed the dominant iconophilia. Thus iconoclasm has become subordinate to iconophilia: the symbolic martyrdom of the image only strengthens our belief in it.

And that is precisely the point at which the documentation becomes indispensable, producing the life of the living thing as such: the documentation inscribes the existence of an object in history, gives a lifespan to this existence, and gives the object life as such—independently of whether this object was “originally” living or artifcial. The difference between the living and the artifcial is, then, exclusively a narrative difference. It cannot be observed but only told, only documented: an object can be given a prehistory, a genesis, an origin by means of narrative. The technical documentation is, incidentally, never constructed as history but always as a system of instructions for producing particular objects under given circumstances. The artistic documentation, whether real or fctive, is, by contrast, primarily narrative, and thus it evokes the unrepeatability of living time. The artifcial can thus be made living, made natural, by means of art documentation, by narrating the history of its origin, its “making.” Art documentation is thus the art of making living things out of artifcial ones, a living activity out of technical practice: it is a bio-art that is simultaneously biopolitics. This basic function of art documentation was strikingly demonstrated by Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner. In the flm, the artifcially produced humans, called “replicants,” are given photographic documentation at the time they are produced, which is supposed to certify their “natural origin”—faked photographs of their family, residences, and so on. Although this documentation is fctive, it gives the replicants life—subjectivity—which makes them indistinguishable from the “natural” human beings on the “inside” as well as on the outside. Because the replicants are inscribed in life, in history, by means of this documentation, they can continue this life in an uninterrupted and thoroughly individual way. Consequently, the hero’s search for a “real,” objectively determinable distinction between the natural and the artifcial ultimately proves to be futile, because, as we have seen, this distinction can be established only through an artistically documented narrative. The fact that life is something that can be documented but not immediately experienced is not a new discovery. One could even claim that this is the defnition of life: life can be documented but not shown. In his book 56 57

Benjamin himself calls attention to this possibility when he writes about the fgure of profane illumination and refers to the forms of life that can lead to such a profane illumination: “The reader, the thinker, the loiterer, the f âneur, are types of illuminati just as much as the opium eater, the dreamer, the ecstatic.”9 One is struck by the fact that these fgures of profane illumination are also fgures of motion— especially the f âneur. The f âneur does not demand of things that they come to him; he goes to things. In this sense, the f âneur does not destroy the auras of things; he respects them. Or rather, only through him does the aura emerge again. The fgure of profane illumination is the reversal of the “loss of aura” that comes from siting the copy in a topology of undetermined circulation though the modern mass media.

Far from it, for it is the images of wreckage and destruction themselves that serve as the icons of new values. In the eyes of the avant-garde the iconoclastic gesture represents an artistic device, deployed less as a means of destroying old icons than as a way to generate new images—or, indeed, new icons.

That further means: A digital image, to be seen, should not be merely exhibited but staged, performed. Here the image begins to function analogously to a piece of music, whose score, as is generally known, is not identical to the musical piece—the score itself being silent. For music to resound, it has to be performed. Thus one can say that digitalization turns the visual arts into a performing art. But to perform something is to interpret it, to betray it, to distort it. Every performance is an interpretation and every interpretation is a betrayal, a misuse. The situation is especially diffcult in the case of the invisible original: If the original is visible it can be compared to a copy—so the copy can be corrected and the feeling of betrayal reduced. But if the original is invisible no such comparison is possible—any visualization remains uncertain. Here the fgure of the curator arises again—and it becomes even more powerful than it was before, because the curator becomes now not only the exhibitor but the performer of the image. The curator does not simply show an image that was originally there but not seen. Rather, the contemporary curator turns the invisible into the visible. By doing so the curator makes choices that modify the performed image in a substantial way. The curator does this frst of all by selecting the technology that should be used to visualize the image data. The information technology is constantly changing nowadays—hardware, software—simply everything is in fux. Because of this the image is already transformed with every act of visualization using a different, new technology. Today’s technology thinks in terms of generations—we speak of computer generations, of generations of photographic and video equipment.

As such a site the museum differs from any other site primarily in its design, in its architecture. It is no coincidence that in recent years attention has shifted from the museum collection to museum architecture. Nevertheless, the museum today has not abandoned entirely its promise of profane immortality. The art documentation that is collected in museums and other art institutions can always be exhibited anew as art. This distinguishes the art projects collected in museums from the life projects documented in other archives: realizing art as art means exhibiting it. And the museum can do that. It is, admittedly, possible to present a life project anew in a reality outside the museum, but only if it itself ultimately concerns an artistic project. This kind of rediscovery of art documentation is, however, only possible because it continues the focus on multiple authorship. Old art documents are restored, transferred to other media, rearranged, installed, and presented in other spaces. Under such conditions it is meaningless to speak of an individual, intact authorship. The artwork as exhibited art documentation is kept alive because its multiple authorships continue to multiply and proliferate; and the site of this proliferation and multiplication of authorship is the present-day museum. The transformation of the artwork into art documentation by means of its own archiving also enables art today to draw on, in an artistic context, the immense reservoir of documentation of other events and projects that our civilization has collected. And indeed the formulation and documentation of various projects is the main activity of modern man. Whatever one wishes to undertake in business, politics, or culture, the frst thing that must be done is to formulate a corresponding project in order to present an application for the approval or fnancing of this project to one or more responsible authorities.

As such a site the museum differs from any other site primarily in its design, in its architecture. It is no coincidence that in recent years attention has shifted from the museum collection to museum architecture. Nevertheless, the museum today has not abandoned entirely its promise of profane immortality. The art documentation that is collected in museums and other art institutions can always be exhibited anew as art. This distinguishes the art projects collected in museums from the life projects documented in other archives: realizing art as art means exhibiting it. And the museum can do that. It is, admittedly, possible to present a life project anew in a reality outside the museum, but only if it itself ultimately concerns an artistic project. This kind of rediscovery of art documentation is, however, only possible because it continues the focus on multiple authorship.

Frequently, however, many of the project proposals that our civilization is constantly producing are lost or simply thrown away after they are rejected. This careless approach to the art form of the project formulation is quite regrettable, really, because it often prevents us from analyzing and understanding the hopes and visions of the future that are invested in these proposals, and these things can say more about our society than anything else

This fact prompts the widespread outcry that all cities now increasingly resemble one another and are beginning to homogenize, with the result that when a tourist arrives in a new city he ends up seeing the same things he encountered in all the other cities. This experience of similarity among all contemporary cities often misleads the observer to assume that the globalization process is erasing local cultural idiosyncrasies, identities, and differences. The truth is not that these distinctions have disappeared, but that they in turn have also embarked on a journey, started to reproduce themselves and to expand. For quite a while now we have been able to enjoy the delights of Chinese cooking not only in China, but also in New York, Paris, and Dortmund. On speculating in which cultural surroundings Chinese food tastes best, the answer is not necessarily “China.” If we go to China today and fail to experience Chinese cities as being exotic, this is by no means simply because 104 105

The avant-garde art discourse makes use of many concepts from the military sphere, including the notion of the avant-garde itself. There is talk of exploding norms, destroying traditions, violating taboos, practicing certain artistic strategies, attacking the existing institutions, and the like. From this we can see that not only does modern art go along with, illustrate, laud, or criticize war as it did earlier, but also wages war itself. The artists of the classical avant-garde saw themselves as agents of negation, destruction, eradication of all traditional forms of art. In accordance with the famous dictum “negation is creation,” which was inspired by the Hegelian dialectic and propagated by authors such as Bakunin and Nietzsche under the title of “active nihilism,” avant-garde artists felt themselves empowered to create new icons through destruction of the old ones. A modern work of art was measured by how radical it was, how far the artist had gone in destroying artistic tradition. Although in the meanwhile the modernity itself has often enough been declared passé, to this very day this criterion of radicalness has lost nothing of its relevance to our evaluation of art. The worst thing that can be said of an artist continues to be that his or her art is “harmless.” This means that modern art has a more than ambivalent relationship with violence, with terrorism. An artist’s negative reaction to repressive, stateorganized power is something that almost goes without saying. Artists who are committed to the tradition of modernity will feel themselves unambiguously compelled by this tradition to defend the individual’s sovereignty against state oppression. But the artist’s attitude toward individual and revolutionary violence is more complicated, insofar as it also practices a radical affrmation of the individual’s sovereignty over the state. There is a long history behind the profound inner complicity between modern art and modern revolutionary, individual violence. In both cases, radical negation is equated with authentic creativity, whether in the area of art or politics. Over and over again this complicity results in a form of rivalry. 122 123

Soviet culture as a whole may therefore be understood as an attempt to abolish that split between the avant-garde and mass culture that Greenberg diagnosed as the main effect of art operating under the conditions of Western-style capitalism.7 Accordingly, all other oppositions related to this fundamental opposition—between production and reproduction, original and copy, quality and quantity, for instance—lost their relevance in the framework of Soviet culture. The primary interest of Socialist Realism was not an artwork but a viewer. Soviet art was produced in the relatively frm conviction that people would come to like it when they had become better people, less decadent and less corrupted by bourgeois values.

As I have tried to show, radical politics cannot be dissociated from a certain aesthetic taste—the taste for the universal, for the degree zero of diversity. On the other hand, liberal, marketoriented politics is correlated with the preference for diversity, difference, openness, and heterogeneity. Today, the postmodern taste still prevails. Radical political projects have almost no chance today of being accepted by the public because they do not correlate with the dominant aesthetic sensibility. But the times are changing. And it is very possible that in the near future a new sensibility for radical art and politics will emerge again. 162 163

The tendency in politics to treat art as one of the pretty irrelevancies and to ignore its political relevance is well known. This tendency has even signifcantly increased today, which is especially implausible, because we now live in a time in which most information is communicated by visual means, including political information. Precisely in connection with the debates over political Islam, which have become acute recently, the role of the visual has increased. Politically explosive problems are ignited almost exclusively by images: Danish cartoons, women behind veils, videos of bin Laden. Islamic fundamentalists address the outside world primarily through the medium of video—despite Islam’s supposed hostility to images. But even a much simpler example demonstrates what it is about today: When the question of multiculturalism is discussed on the TV, the visual is inevitably of a street in a European city dominated by passers-by whose skin color differs from that of the “original” European population. This gives the impression that culture here functions de facto as a pseudonym for race. As a result, simply transferring a certain discourse into the visual makes it racist—even if that is not explicitly intended. Thus the dependence of today’s politics on the images with which it operates is obvious. It is part of the traditional repertoire of European art to depict oneself as a dangerous, cruel alien. Thus Nietzsche presented himself as an envoy of the Übermensch and Bataille as a champion of cruel Aztec rituals. This tradition of presenting oneself as an evil outsider began at the very latest with Marquis de Sade and developed during black Romanticism and its cult of the satanic into one of the major traditions of European art. And it was not always restricted to art. Already in the nineteenth century there were many artists and intellectuals who not only had sympathies with terrorism but actively 178 179

The underestimation in our time of the effect of art on the public consciousness is related above all to the fact that art is identifed frst and foremost as the art market and the work of art as a commodity. The fact that art functions in the context of the art market and that every work of art is a commodity is beyond doubt. The work of art is, however, not just a commodity but also a statement in public space. Art is also made and exhibited for those who do not wish to purchase it—indeed, they constitute the overwhelming majority of the audience for art

And it is becoming part of mass culture not as the production of individual objects that are traded on the art market but as an exhibition praxis that combines architecture, design, and fashion—just as the guiding intellectual fgures of the avant-garde, such as the artists from Bauhaus, Vkhutemas, and others had predicted as early as the 1920s and 1930s. But does that mean that art today has become completely identical with mass culture and has completely lost its ability to transcend its boundaries and thus to refect on itself ? I do not believe so. Mass culture—or let’s call it entertainment—has a dimension that is often overlooked but is extremely relevant to the problems of otherness or alienness. Mass culture addresses everyone simultaneously. A pop concert or flm screening creates communities of viewers. These communities are transitory; their members do not know one another; their composition is arbitrary; it remains unclear where all these people came from and where they are going; they have little or nothing to say to one another; they lack a shared identity, a common prehistory that could have produced common memories they could share—and despite all that they are communities. These communities recall the communities of those traveling on a train or airplane. To put it another way, they are radically contemporary communities—much more contemporary than religious communities, political communities, or labor collectives. All those traditional communities emerged historically and presume that their members are linked to one another from the outset by something that derives from their shared past—a shared language, a shared faith, a shared political belief, a shared education that enables them to do a certain job. Such communities always have specifc boundaries—and they close themselves off from all those with whom they have no shared past. Mass culture, by contrast, creates communities irrespective of any shared past—communities with no preconditions, communities of a new type. This is the source of their enormous potential for modernization, which is so often overlooked. But mass culture itself is usually not capable of refecting on and developing this potential fully, because the communities it creates 180 181

With the rise of the Web, writing has met its photography. By that, I mean that writing has encountered a situation similar to that of painting upon the invention of photography, a technology so much better at doing what the art form had been trying to do that, to survive, the field had to alter its course radically. If photography was striving for sharp focus, painting was forced to go soft, hence impressionism. Faced with an unprecedented amount of available digital text, writing needs to redefine itself to adapt to the new environment of textual abundance.

That the separation of form and function, of concept and execution, is not likely to produce objects of esthetic value has been repeatedly demonstrated. Similarly, it has been shown that the system which regards esthetics as irrelevant, which separates the artist from his product, which fragments the work of the individual, which creates by committee, and which makes mincemeat of the creative process will, in the long run, diminish not only the product but the maker as well.

However, for an advertisement to hold its own in a competitive race, the designer must steer clear of visual clichés by some unexpected interpretation of the commonplace. He does this partly by simplifying, by abstracting, by symbolizing. If the resulting visual image is in any way ambiguous, it may be supplemented by one which is more clearly recognizable.

production. We intend such a parallel to be regarded as merely phenomenological: we are here drawing no conclusions whatsoever as to the nature and the relationship of the two productions, nor does the parallel we are about to establish provide any sort of a priori answer to the question whether desiring-production and social production are really two separate and distinct productions. Its one purpose is to point out the fact that the forms of social production, like those of desiring-production, involve an unengendered nonproductive attitude, an element of antiproduction coupled with the process, a full body that functions as a socius. This socius may be the body of the earth, that of the tyrant, or capital. This is the body that Marx is referring to when he says that it is not the product of labor, but rather appears as its natural or divine presupposition. In fact, it does not restrict itself merely to opposing productive forces in and of themselves. It falls back on (il se rabat sur)* all production, constituting a surface over which the forces and agents of production are distributed, thereby appropriating for itself all surplus production and arrogating to itself both the whole and the parts of the process, which now seem to emanate from it as a quasi cause. Forces and agents come to represent a miraculous form of its own power: they appear to be "miraculated" (miracules) by it. In a word, the socius as a full body forms a surface where all production is recorded, whereupon the entire process appears to emanate from this recording surface. Society constructs its own delirium by recording the process of production; but it is not a conscious delirium, or rather is a true consciousness of a false movement, a true perception of an apparent objective movement, a true perception of the movement that is produced on the recording surface. Capital is indeed the body without organs of the capitalist, or rather of the capitalist being. But as such, it is not only the fluid and petrified substance of money, for it will give to the sterility of money the form whereby money produces money. It produces surplus value, just as the body without organs reproduces itself, puts forth shoots, and branches out to the farthest corners of the universe. It makes the machine responsible for producing a relative surplus value, while embodying itself in the machine as fixed capital. Machines and agents cling so *The verb se rabattre sur (and the noun rebattemenl), used by the authors here and in numerous instances in the text below, has several different connotations, as lor instance: in descriptive geometry, to describe the rotation of a plane so as to coincide with another plane, usually followed by a reverse rotation back into its original position; a retreat to a previously held position, as in a battle; and a reduction to a lower level.

Desire is not bolstered by needs, but rather the contrary; needs are derived from desire: they are counterproducts within the real that desire produces. Lack is a countereffect of desire; it is deposited, distributed, vacuolized within a real that is natural and social. Desire always remains in close touch with the conditions of objective existence; it embraces them and follows them, shifts when they shift, and does not outlive them. For that reason it so often becomes the desire to die, whereas need is a measure of the withdrawal of a subject that has lost its desire at the same time that it loses the passive syntheses of these conditions. This is precisely the significance of need as a search in a void: hunting about, trying to capture or become a parasite of passive syntheses in whatever vague world they may happen to exist in. It is no use saying: We are not green plants; we have long since been unable to synthesize chlorophyll, so it's necessary to eat. ... Desire then becomes this abject fear of lacking something. But it should be noted that this is not a phrase uttered by the poor or the dispossessed. On the contrary, such people know that they are close to grass, almost akin to it, and that desire "needs" very few things-not those leftovers that chance to come their way, but the very things that are continually taken from them-and that what is missing is not things a subject feels the lack of somewhere deep down inside himself, but rather the objectivity of man, the objective being of man, for whom to desire is to produce, to produce within the realm of the real. The real is not impossible; on the contrary, within the real everything is possible, everything becomes possible. Desire does not express a molar lack within the subject; rather, the molar organization deprives desire of its objective being. Revolutionaries, artists, and seers are content to be objective, merely objective: they know that desire clasps life in its powerfully productive embrace, and reproduces it in a way that is all the more intense because it has few needs. And never mind those who believe that this is very easy to say, or that it is the sort of idea to be found in books. "From the little reading I had done I had observed that the men who were most in life, who were moulding life, who were life itself, ate little, slept little, owned little or nothing.

The pervert is someone who takes the artifice seriously and plays the game to the hilt: if you want them, you can have them-territorialities infinitely more artificial than the ones that society offers us, totally artificial new families, secret lunar societies. As for the schizo, continually wandering about, migrating here, there, and everywhere as best he can, he plunges further and further into the realm of deterritorialization, reaching the furthest limits of the decomposition of the socius on the surface of his own body without organs. It may well be that these peregrinations are the schizo's own particular way of rediscovering the earth. The schizophrenic deliberately seeks out the very limit of capitalism: he is its inherent tendency brought to fulfillment, its surplus product, its proletariat, and its exterminating angel. He scrambles all the codes and is the transmitter of the decoded flows of desire. The real continues to flow. In the schizo, the two aspects ofprocess are conjoined: the metaphysical process that puts us in contact with the "demoniacal" element in nature or within the heart of the earth, and the historical process of social production that restores the autonomy of desiring-machines in relation to the deterritori-alized social machine. Schizophrenia is desiring-production as the limit of social production. Desiring-production, and its difference in regime as compared to social production, are thus end points, not points of departure. Between the two there is nothing but an ongoing process of becoming that is the becoming of reality. And if materialist psychiatry may be defined as the psychiatry that introduces the concept of production into consideration of the problem of desire, it cannot avoid posing in eschatological terms the problem of the ultimate relationship between the analytic machine, the revolutionary machine, and desiring-machines.

moment ago that the schizo is at the very limit of the decoded flows of desire, we meant that he was at the very limit of the social codes, where a despotic Signifier destroys all the chains, linearizes them, biunivocalizes them, and uses the bricks as so many immobile units for the construction of an imperial Great Wall of China. But the schizo continually detaches them, continually works them loose and carries them off in every direction in order to create a new polyvocity that is the code of desire. Every composition, and also every decomposition, uses mobile bricks as the basic unit. Diaschisis and diaspasis, as Monakow put it: either a lesion spreads along fibers that link it to other regions and thus gives rise at a distance to phenomena that are incomprehensible from a purely mechanistic (but not a machinic) point of view; or else a humoral disturbance brings on a shift in nervous energy and creates broken, fragmented paths within the sphere of instincts. These bricks or blocks are the essential parts of desiring-machines from the point of view of the recording process: they are at once component parts and products of the process of decomposition that are spatially localized only at certain moments, by contrast with the nervous system, which is a great chronogeneous machine: a melody-producing machine of the "music box" type, with a nonspatiallocalization.35 What makes Monakow and Mourgue's study an unparalleled one, going far beyond the entire Jacksonist philosophy that originally inspired it, is the theory of bricks or blocks, their detachment and fragmentation, and above all what such a theory presupposes: the introduction of desire into neurology. The third type of interruption or break characteristic of the desiring-machine is the residual break (coupure-reste) or residuum, which produces a subject alongside the machine, functioning as a part adjacent to the machine. And if this subject has no specific or personal identity, if it traverses the body without organs without destroying its indifference, it is because it is not only a part that is peripheral to the machine, but also a part that is itself divided into parts that corres- 40 ANTI-OEDIPUS

The novelty of cenoby is that, by taking literally the Pauline prescription of unceasing prayer (adialeiptōs proseuchesthe; 1 Thess. 5:17), it transforms the whole of life into an Office by way of temporal scansion. Confronted with this apostolic precept, the patristic tradition had drawn the consequence from it that Origen sums up in his De oratione, namely, that the only possible way to understand this precept is that “the entire life of the saint taken as a whole is a single great prayer, [and] prayer in the ordinary sense ought to be made no less than three times each day” (Origen, De oratione 12.1).

One could not more clearly express the fact that the monastic ideal is that of a total mobilization of existence through time.

The spiritualization of the work of the hands that is accomplished in this way can be seen as a significant precursor of the Protestant ascesis of labor, of which capitalism, according to Max Weber, represents the secularization. And if the Christian liturgy, which culminates in the creation of the liturgical year and the cursus horarum, has been effectively defined as a “sanctification of time,” in which every day and every hour is constituted as a “memorial of the works of God and the mysteries of Christ” (Righetti, p. 1), the cenobitic project can on the contrary be defined more precisely as a sanctification of life by means of time.

In this sense, the monastery is perhaps the first place in which life itself—and not only the ascetic techniques that form and regulate it—was presented as an art. This analogy must not be understood, however, in the sense of an aestheticization of existence, but rather in the sense that Michel Foucault seemed to have in mind in his last writings, namely a definition of life itself in relation to a never-ending practice.

ceasing to be differences. We are statistically or molarly heterosexual, but personally homosexual, without knowing it or being fully aware of it, and finally we are transsexual in an elemental, molecular sense. That is why Proust, the first to deny all oedipalizing interpretations of his own interpretations, contrasts two kinds of homosexuality, or rather two regions only one of which is Oedipal, exclusive, and depressive, the other being anoedipal schizoid, included, and inclusive: "For some, doubtless those whose childhoods were timid, the material kind of pleasure they take does not matter, so long as they can relate it to a male countenance. While others, whose sensuality is doubtless more violent, give their material pleasure certain imperious localizations. The second group would shock most people by their avowals. They live perhaps less exclusively under Saturn's satellite, for in their case women are not entirely excluded.... But those in the second group seek out women who prefer women, women who suggest young men ... indeed, they can take, with such women, the same pleasure as with a man.... For in their relations with women, they play-for the woman who prefers women-the role of another woman, and at the same time a woman offers them approximately what they find in a man. "15 The opposition here is between two uses of the connective syntheses: a global and specific use, and a partial and nonspecific use. In the first, desire at the same time receives a fixed subject, an ego specified according to a given sex, and complete objects defined as global persons. The complexity and the foundations of such an operation appear more distinctly if we consider the mutual reactions between the different syntheses of the unconscious following a given use. It is first of all the synthesis of recording that in effect situates, on its surface of inscription within the conditions of Oedipus, a definable and differentiable ego in relation to parental images serving as co-ordinates (mother, father). There we have a triangulation that implies in its essence a constituent prohibition, and that conditions the differentiation between persons: prohibition of incest with the mother, prohibition against taking the father's place. But a strange sort of reasoning leads one to conclude that, since it is forbidden, that very thing was desired. In reality, global persons-even the very form of persons-do not exist prior to the prohibitions that weigh on them and constitute them, any more than they exist prior to the triangulation into which they enter: desire receives its first complete objects and is forbidden them at one and the same time. Therefore it is indeed the same Oedipal operation that lays the foundations for the possibility of its own "resolution," by way of a differentia- 70 ANTi-OEDIPUS

Just as in the syntagmas regula iuris and regula fidei, law and faith are not directed by the rule or derived from it, but vice versa, in the same way it is possible that in the syntagma regula vitae it is not so much the form of life that is to be derived from the rule as the rule from the form of life. Or perhaps it should rather be said that the movement goes in both directions and that, in the incessant tension toward the realization of a threshold of indifference, the rule is made life to the same extent that life is made rule.

In the words of Bonagratia, sicut equus habet usus facti, “as the horse has de facto use but not property rights over the oats that it eats, so the religious who has abdicated all property has the simple de facto use [usum simplicem facti] of bread, wine, and clothes” (Bonagratia, p. 511). From the perspective that is of interest to us here, Franciscanism can be defined—and in this consists its novelty, even today unthought, and in the present conditions of society, totally unthinkable—as the attempt to realize a human life and practice absolutely outside the determinations of the law.

The preoccupation with constructing a justification of use in juridical terms prevented them from collecting the hints of a theory of use present in the Pauline letters, in particular in 1 Corinthians 7:20–31, in which using the world as not using it or not abusing it (et qui utuntur hoc mundo, tamquam non utantur; the original Greek hōs mē katachromenoi means “as not abusing”) defined the Christian’s form of life.

She always reconducted him to the first step of the stairs. When his horse had not yet been brought round she stayed there. They had said, “Good-bye”; there was no more talking. The open air wrapped her round, playing with the soft down on the back of her neck, or blew to and fro on her hips her apron-strings, that fluttered like streamers. Once, during a thaw, the bark of the trees in the yard was oozing, the snow on the roofs of the out-buildings was melting; she stood on the threshold, and went to fetch her sunshade and opened it. The sunshade, of silk of the colour of pigeons’ breasts, through which the sun shone, lighted up with shifting hues the white skin of her face. She smiled under the tender warmth, and drops of water could be heard falling one by one on the stretched silk.

When all was over at the cemetery Charles went home.

She had loved him after all.

When he had gone about a hundred paces he stopped, and as he saw the cart disappearing, its wheels turning in the dust, he gave a deep sigh. Then he remembered his wedding, the old times, the first pregnancy of his wife; he, too, had been very happy the day when he had taken her from her father to his home, and had carried her off on a pillion, trotting through the snow, for it was near Christmas-time; and the country was all white. She held him by one arm, her basket hanging from the other; the wind blew the long lace of her Cauchois head-dress so that it sometimes flapped across his mouth, and when he turned his head he saw near him, on his shoulder, her little rosy face, smiling silently under the gold bands of her cap. To warm her hands she put them from time to time in his breast. How long ago it all was! Their son would have been thirty by now. Then he looked back and saw nothing on the road.

A shell-box adorned the chest of drawers, and on the secretary near the window a bouquet of orange blossoms tied with white satin ribbons stood in a bottle. It was a bride’s bouquet; it was the other one’s. She looked at it. Charles noticed it; he took it and carried it up to the attic, while Emma seated in an armchair (they were putting her things down around her) thought of her bridal flowers packed up in a bandbox, and wondered, dreaming, what would be done with them if she were to die.

Those who were beginning to grow old had an air of youth, while there was something mature in the faces of the young. In their unconcerned looks was the calm of passions daily satiated, and through all their gentleness of manner pierced that peculiar brutality, the result of a command of half-easy things, in which force is exercised and vanity amused—the management of thoroughbred horses and the society of loose women.

Love, she thought, must come suddenly, with great outbursts and light nings,—a hurricane of the skies, which falls upon life, revolutionises it, roots up the will like a leaf, and sweeps the whole heart into the abyss.

Sometimes I wondered if there was a correlation between Peter always buying himself the crappy stuff and him choosing me: a thrifty, generic brown one, instead of name-brand white one with blond hair. He had rummaged through the bin and said, “This brown one will do. It has all the same parts as the white one.” He liked things that were a little damaged or messed up. It gave him some kind of weird thrill. He mistook damage for having character.

“Madame Bovary, c‘est moi,” Flaubert famously stated when his book was a hit and he was hounded by critics and fans to identify the real-life, verité source of his character. Yet he also liked saying the opposite: “There’s nothing in Madame Bovary that’s drawn from life,” he wrote to Mlle. Leroyer de Chantepie in a letter dated March 18, 1857. “It’s a completely invented story. None of my own feelings or experiences are in it.” And yet Flaubert also wrote, in his youth, “There are days when one would like to be an athlete, and others when one longs to be a woman. In the first case it is because our muscles are aquiver; in the second, because our flesh is yearning and ablaze” (Intimate Notebook, p. 47).

Students should have to develop fully thought-out written proposals before, during, and after painting and sculpting. I don’t mean that they should do this simply to defend an image or object during individual and group critiques, as students have always done, but to learn how to justify that creation intellectually, beyond the subjective, in our visually dense and materially cluttered world. If they don’t want to do this, they have no business being professional contemporary artists. They should be doctors and lawyers who paint on Sunday, or they should be the fne two-dimensional technicians who paint for Jef Koons. We are all creative; creativity is part of the human condition.However, not everyone is a cultural producer. Our art schools’ counseling departments should be sharper in vocational counseling.

Listen to the great paranoiac din beneath the discourse of reason that speaks for others, in the name of the silent majority. The explanation is that, beneath preconscious goals and interests, a uniquely unconscious investment rises up that embraces a full body for itself, independently of all aims, and a degree of development for itself, independently of all reason: that very degree and no other, don't take another step; that very socius and no other, hands off. A disinterested love of the molar machine, a veritable enjoyment, with all the hatred it contains for those who do not submit to the molar machine: the entire libido is at stake

Even the most overt fascism speaks the language of goals, of law, order, and reason. Even the most insane capitalism speaks in the name of economic rationality. And this is necessarily the case, since it is in the irrationality of the full body that the order of reasons is inextricably fixed, under a code, under an axiomatic that determines it. What is more, the bringing to light of the unconscious reactionary investment as if devoid of an aim, would be enough to transform it completely, to make it pass to the other pole of the libido, i.e., to the schizorevolutionary pole, since this

He screamed Connell’s name, and began to kiss his head with wild exuberant kisses. It was only one-all, and there were still twenty minutes left on the clock. But that was their world then. Their feelings were suppressed so carefully in everyday life, forced into smaller and smaller spaces, until seemingly minor events took on insane and frightening significance. It was permissible to touch each other and cry during football matches.

Marianne is a masochist and Connell is simply too nice of a guy to hit a woman. This, after all, is the literal level on which the incident took place. She asked him to hit her and when he said he didn’t want to, she wanted to stop having sex. So why, despite its factual accuracy, does this feel like a dishonest way of narrating what happened? What is the missing element, the excluded part of the story that explains what upset them both? It has something to do with their history, he knows that. Ever since school he has understood his power over her. How she responds to his look or the touch of his hand. The way her face colours, and she goes still as if awaiting some spoken order. His effortless tyranny over someone who seems, to other people, so invulnerable.

Perhaps ours is not a world of information but a wall of noise, a screeching mélange of incompatible equations into which we have no real choice but to enter into directly: scrambled territories, institutions, constitutions, sovereignties, citizenships, hardwares, softwares, protocols, interfaces, databases, patterns, platforms, cities, muscles, skins, organs, failing presumptions, exotic refrains, domains, settlements, penultimate boundaries—or, better yet, directly into the forms-to-come, for which each of these legacies is just an ancestral ante-image. There is less forward and backward than entropy and negentropy, oblivion and not oblivion, imminent or deferred utopia. As such, any design authorship must understand that the dynamics at work now are—for better and worse—simultaneously and interchangeably both futuristic and archaic, at once both technocratic and theocratic.

In starting with and from political theory in this first part, it is important to acknowledge in advance that “sovereignty” is positioned as a question, not as a given conclusion. The implication is not that software is new and sovereignty is timeless, thereby leading one to ask how sovereignty now works through software, but rather that both are now mutually contingent and that the work of software at a global scale itself produces unfamiliar sorts of sovereignties.

He argued that one of the things that makes neoliberalism unique is that markets do not operate in conjunction with or in conflict with sovereign states, but rather that sovereignty is itself shifted from states into markets. For sovereign markets, rights of economic exchange supersede the governance of public order at the level of the individual and the collective.

The Schmittian primal scenes are the plowing of a field, taken and defended, and the state's duty to build good walls around it. These sovereignties over place are materially substantiated by a defended occupation of place that is supposed to outlast the prosthetic logistical visions of Roman surveyors who have come and gone. Two lines: the ox draws its line into the absolute place of this soil, whereas the itinerant emissary of empire superimposes his invisible geometry—one a true fact and the other a temporary mathematical conjecture.

Just as a battle begins in a state of equilibrium between the two sides, which gradually alters one way or the other until it is clear that the balance has tilted so far that the issue can no longer be in doubt--so this gathering of rabbits in the dark, beginning with hesitant approaches, silences, pauses, movements, crouchings side by side and all manner of tentative appraisals, slowly moved, like a hemisphere of the world into summer, to a warmer, brighter region of mutual liking and approval, until all felt sure that they had nothing to fear. Pipkin, some way away from Hazel, crouched at his ease between two huge rabbits who could have broken his back in a second, while Buckthorn and Cowslip started a playful scuffle, nipping each other like kittens and then breaking off to comb their ears in a comical pretense of sudden gravity.

Platforms are formally neutral but remain, each and every one, uniquely “ideological” in how they realize particular strategies for organizing their publics. They are identified with neoliberalism (not without reason), but their origins lie as much within the utopian megastructures of 1960s experimental architecture, counterculture cybernetics, Soviet planning schemes, and many other systems of sociotechnical governance, both realized and imagined. Platforms are infrastructural but rely heavily on aesthetic expression and calibration.

The entwined polar positions of Sunnyvale, Caracas, Beijing, Brussels, Tribeca, and Tel Aviv don't integrate capital and resource markets into network societies on their own, but are themselves “computed” into these arrangements. Either way, it is possible to delineate structural causality between technological and socioeconomic systems only in model abstractions, because one always contains the other and is contained by the other at once.

We cannot, for example, finally locate computation technologies as a base and information culture as a superstructure, bound together either through capital-intensive modes of production and exchange or through computational flows directly determining systems of valuation and exchange in their image. Rather, we could do so, but only with abstractions that are easily turned inside out.

The User's enumeration is first a grotesquely individuated self-image, a profile, but as the same process is oversubscribed by data that trace all the things that affect the User, now included in the profile, the persona that first promises coherency and closure brings an explosion and liquefaction of self.

Although the twentieth century invented computers, it did not invent computation so much as it discovered it as a general force, and offered some initial basic tools to work with it more directly.

Grosz links the act of framing, however, not to the subtractive competition of natural selection but to the multiplicative energy of sexual selection and its economies of display, expenditure, and abundance. In her Darwinian parable, the animal draws territory with its paw, its wing, or song refrain not only to fend off predators but also to stage itself in the view of a mate. She quotes from Deleuze and Félix Guattari's last collaboration: “Every morning the Scenopoetes dentirostris, a bird of the Australian rain forests, cuts leaves, makes them fall to the ground, and turns them over so that the paler internal side contrasts with the earth. In this way it constructs a stage for itself like a ready-made; and directly above, on a creeper or branch, while fluffing its feathers beneath its beak to reveal their yellow roots, it sings a complex song made up from its own notes and, at intervals, those of other birds that it imitates; it is a complete artist.” Beyond what is needed for survival in the moment, this act of self-framing sets the world in motion with a composition that motivates communion.

Again, authority and its authorship can speak only to what it can see and sense, and in turn what it can measure, and so geopolitics and geoscopy are always bound up with one another.

In dialogue with the new externalized perspectives of the space age, this was not lost on art and design, and the very early years of planetary computation and global media (approximately 1964 to 1975) saw an explosion of land art, earthworks, and speculative megastructural architecture.

Computation is training governance to see the world as it does and to be blind like it is.
