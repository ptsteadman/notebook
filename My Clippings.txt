why do people hate listening to dreams? i used to hate it too. at some point i started thinking ‘it’s not any less real than being awake, you’re ‘hating’ for irrational reasons. ’ 8:18 - 8:30PM: talked with colin on phone. i will make a copy of my application and send tomorrow. seems strange to do this, like.hm. you probably get why it’s strange.8:30-11:15PM: talked with mom. MOM CONVERSATION HIGHLIGHTS: -telling me she referred to a period of her life where she was mostly miserable and the only hope was that it would end by dying ‘the abyss. ’ she said ‘i thought i was in hell and my dad was the devil, i really believed that was happening. ’ she thought this every day but never told anyone. i said ‘i feel like i’m in hell right now but dad’s okay. ’ 193

In the month I’ve been doing this, no one has called me out on how self-absorbed/obsessed I am, how I’m not intelligent or cultured, how I’m not contributing anything to society, how it’s weird that my lifestyle is to rarely sleep and talk almost exclusively to my parents, who I also live with, how irresponsible I am about my physical and mental health and how drugs are bad and I’m addicted, how I contradict myself (can’t think of examples but I’m sure I do it), how my ‘voice’ is just the combination of like five clearer stronger ‘voices’ I like I don’t know whether to say ‘thank you’ or People just like it when I’m funny or insightful246

And also defined by being on a lake that is warm and calm and has a dock and some boats and jetskis to ride around in. When you ride one of these things you have no where to go and no purpose besides having some fun. It's the same sort of excess where you can start drinking beer at 11am. And a hammock and a chaise lounge that you can alternate between lying on. And the most beautiful sunsets. For dinner you can eat steak and grilled corn and drink nice red wine and eat apple strudels heated on the barbecue with 10 year old cheddar melted on it. This all actually happened, I almost wish I could make it up, because then I would be capable of even imagining something so nice. Instead things this nice only really come along through piecemeal happenstance.

The whole idea is that being a NEET is about setting your range of expectations and basically defining the scope of your world. So you think “I will play Senran Kagura and I hope to unlock some new exciting outfits!”. You don't know what the outfits will be, sure, but there is no outfit that will fall outside your scope. Or like “I will look at some posts on /jp/”, that's a good example. 99% of the time there's no posts that will fall outside of that scope. But sometime there are, and Janny won't get to them quick enough, and then that's an externality. Do you get it?

instead of selling me a refurbished used computer. He said ‘machine. ’ I like it when computer people call computers ‘machines’ instead. Got a little turned on writing that, imagining the mind of a computer person, feeling insecure that computers aren’t as ‘machine-y’ as other machines like cars but they’re technically still machines. Seems sexy, frail. Frail and knowable. I would say ‘I’d like to see the machine’ when I pick up repaired computer, then he’d retrieve it from the back (I’d let him retrieve it to increase waiting time so there could be a bigger-feeling reward, because I too am looking out for his best value) then I’d take it from him and set it aside without breaking eye contact and say, ‘I’d like to see the other machine, the one in the back,’ moving closer and just…Jesus lol…grabbing his button-down where it meets the pants. Pulling it out. Right on the button line. I would be pulling from the button line, because it’s like a little handle. Zoom in for a close inspection of the freckle/mole face area. Check to see if that shit needs refurbishing. Refurbish the shit out of that face mole cluster thingy. I think it’s near his eye. Give him a nice him a nice hot quote on that mole cluster, try to get him a good deal, I’ll check online to make sure my deal is the best. Then I’ll call him on Monday, the full refurbishments will have to wait until Monday, because I want to make sure I have ordered and stocked the very best parts. The waiting will increase the reward, also. Forgot I was trying to describe how I froze up around him. It was because of thinking something like that while he was in the back room, expecting he would return ‘less attractive. ’ That face mole thingy though.Hoo. Some real Achilles’ heel type shit, me and face moles. IT’S LIKE HOW DO THEY EVEN GET THERE ON THE FACE, HOW COULD A FACE PRODUCE SUCH A MARVEL, HOW COULD IT KNOW TO GENERATE SUCH A PERFECTLY SHAPED USELESS THING IN THE MIDST OF THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF SENSORY 319

Critics use the term narcissism so loosely that it retains little of its psychological content. They confuse cause and effect. When using the word narcissism as critique, they smell of ideology. In their loosest meaning of the word, they can also mean their own motivated perception of selfishness or self indulgence.

29PM: pictured myself looking ‘calmly dead’ in bed, getting found by mark probably, after transferring all my paypal money (~$350) to my savings account (~$100), spending it all on heroin to combine with all the xanax i have (~20mg) and a bottle of wine. mark would say ‘ah jeez. that’s too bad’ and call whoever you call. that’s if i find out i’m pregnant. i would make sure my cats had enough food for a few days before i did it. i don’t know if i’d leave a note. my note would be an asterisk and my last liveblog update would be ‘* : see above. ’ 2:55PM: chewed caffeine pill with teeth and swallowed. ate noopept. the DMV is 26 minutes away. i think i got this. i can do this today. decided ‘lacking interest in food’ depression is better than the alternative, for health459

chris killen thing marathon style.~4700 words. great job shitty shoo.10:44PM: it’s 10:44PM now. just so you.know. i’m addressing that the beginning of the ending of this break ends at ‘10:44PM:’ so that probably means right now it is 10:44PM, i think you know that, addressing it now though.officially. going to resume transcribing chris’ thing 11:05PM. everything i remember doing from 9:02-10:44PM: -went to pickles and pies to get more energy drinks/groceries/cat food. talked to myself in ‘chris voice’ while dressing. emailed tao to see if i was taking too long on transcription/if there were money issues.-recorded video of me talking like chris but seems unseemly.-drank remaining liquid in sugar-free red bull can.-saw matthew donahoo text from 7:28PM, picture captioned with ‘My roommate is making grunting sounds while I look at him from the couch’ -started typing response to mira’s text from earlier thinking ‘this will not garner a response but i want to respond more. ’ -approached colin and ‘fancy food friend’ on the way to pickles and pies. seemed like we might not talk but then i said ‘hi. ’ he asked where i was going. i said ‘oh just pickles and pies. ’ he said ‘word. ’ we had already passed each other, i was standing and had turned around to face colin and friend as they continued walking to apartment building. colin said i missed something on saturday, the irish music festival thing. he said ‘my texts. ’ i was holding my phone. i said ‘i dropped my phone’ or something.embarrassed. he said ‘feel free to stop by on your way back, we’re just hanging out. ’ there was a moment. i said ‘have a good night. ’ seemed…obvious…that 478

looked at face/pupils in mirror. pupils big. pictured myself saying ‘hi guys, i’m working on this thing all day and night, transcribing this thing’ and eventually saying the word ‘gig’ and pee running down legs.-ate an amount of vyvanse, think it’s 25mg. it’s the one masha drew something on, i think, to indicate it contained less. texted masha a response thinking ‘this will not garner a response but i want to respond to people more. ’ -willis texted if i’d be home/at rockaway tomorrow and…i thought today was tuesday and tao’s reading was tomorrow and mira’s/scott’s/my baltimore reading was the next day.relieved. i said i might be sleeping during the day probably.11:15PM: drinking monster drink. don’t like typing ‘monster’ ever.ever.EVER.now, especially. shirley on the bed. both windows open. they don’t let you do it in my building after 10PM. it’s okay. it’s okay. when i started typing this i felt insane…abberant…very not-normal lifestyle, very alone, very ‘what am i pretending i know how to do, will it help to call mom?’ lit candles. have been texting with matthew a little and feeling better. back muscles tense. whole back of body. stomach muscles also, like i’ve been exercising. can tell elbows/arms are tensed when i type.headache. chest tightness stuff.okay. chewing trident gum. it is a spearment flavored. i’m leaving it typed like that, that’s what it sounded like in my head. NO BUTTS ABOUT IT. no butts. resuming transcribing at 12:05AM. maybe if i liveblog long enough i’ll eventually become consistent about saying ‘AM/PM’ all of the time or none of the time and figure out what i want ‘number consistency: below 10 = spelled? not? when not?’ and things like that.so. stay tuned for that. that’s right, ‘stay. ’ instructing you to ‘stay’ something, which means…assuming you are already something…‘tuned,’ in this case…instructing you to continue doing what you’re doing, if what you’re doing is what i think you’re doing.okay. just so we’re clear480

zero interest in psychotherapy, zero insight, on the surface all the time’ (dad repeated those phrases maybe three times each during monologue, all context points from previous recurring arguments we’ve had re: me not wanting to do therapy and not liking it, after having tried therapy and it not seeming to work). He said Ted was depressed and wouldn’t leave bed for six months and his son who was three or four years old would walk by his room and say ‘mom, is daddy seeping?’ I said ‘Ted sounds sad. ’ dad said something about how Ted was depressed but didn’t have feelings. I said ‘it feels bad to feel depressed, to have no feelings, I think depression is a feeling. ’ then dad said the ‘zero insight’ things. He and Ted were childhood friends and dad won’t talk to him anymore because Ted got dad and his friends to invest in real estate before shit hit the fan ~2008. Dad thinks Ted is hoarding all their money because he won’t return phone calls. I don’t return phone calls either. That was another thing dad kept repeating, to emphasize Ted’s shittiness: ‘he never returns my calls. ’

That she was dependent on him, and on him alone, even though she might receive orders from persons other than himself, whether he was present or absent, for as a matter of principle he was participating in whatever might be demanded of or inflicted on her, and that it was he who possessed and enjoyed her through those into whose hands she had been given, by the simple fact that he had given her to them. She must greet them and submit to them with the same respect with which she greeted him, as though they were so many reflections of him. Thus he would possess her as a god possesses his creatures, whom he lays hold of in the guise of a monster or a bird, of an invisible spirit or a state of ecstasy.

After the Alma intersection, the Cours la Reine was visible because the trees were bare, and the Place de la Concorde sparkling and dry with, above it, the sort of sky which promises snow, but from which snow has not yet fallen. O heard a little click and felt the warm air rising around her legs: Sir Stephen had turned on the heater.

In the same vein, she would not tolerate not paying whenever they had tea together in some pastry shop. She would kiss her hand and, if she had a chance, her mouth, if possible in the street. But these were so many affectations she paraded for the sake of scandal, displayed much more from childishness than from conviction. On the other hand, her penchant for the sweetness of sweetly made-up lips yielding beneath her own, for the procelain or pearly sparkle of eyes half-closed in the half-light of couches at five in the afternoon, when the curtains are drawn and the lamp on the fireplace mantel lighted, for the voices that say: “Again, oh, please, again …,” for the marine odor clinging to her fingers: this was a real, deeply-rooted taste. And she also enjoyed the pursuit just as much. Probably not for the pursuit itself, however amusing or fascinating it might be, but for the complete sense of freedom she experienced in the act of hunting.

The pleasure she derived from seeing a girl pant beneath her caresses, seeing her eyes close and the tips of her breasts stiffen beneath her lips and teeth, the pleasure she got from exploring her fore and aft with her hand—and from feeling her tighten around her fingers, then sigh and moan—was more than she could bear; and if this pleasure was so intense, it was only because it made her constantly aware of the pleasure which she in turn gave when she tightened around whoever was holding her, whenever she sighed or moaned, with this difference, that she could not conceive of being given thus to a girl, the way this girl was given to her, but only to a man.

Trust had to be won from zero at every encounter. That’s the reason you always see women being so effusive with each other—crying out shrilly upon recognizing each other in the street. Women always have to confirm with each other, even after so many years: We are still all right. But in the exaggeration of their effusiveness, you know that things are not all right between them, and that they never will be.

For so long I had been looking hard into every person I met, hoping I might discover in them all the thoughts and feelings I hoped life would give me, but hadn’t. There are some people who say you have to find such things in yourself, that you cannot count on anyone to supply even the smallest crumb that your life lacks. Although I knew this might be true, it didn’t prevent me from looking anyway. Who cares what people say? What people say has no effect on your heart.

Just as the Argo’s parts may be replaced over time but the boat is still called the Argo, whenever the lover utters the phrase “I love you,” its meaning must be renewed by each use, as “the very task of love and of language is to give to one and the same phrase inflections which will be forever new.”

The answer isn’t just to introduce new words (boi, cisgendered, andro-fag) and then set out to reify their meanings (though obviously there is power and pragmatism here). One must also become alert to the multitude of possible uses, possible contexts, the wings with which each word can fly. Like when you whisper, You’re just a hole, letting me fill you up.

“Calling an interest in Poussin nostalgic or elitist is like calling the interest one has, say, in the person one cares for most deeply ‘hetero- (or homo-) sexist,’ or ‘exclusive’ or ‘proprietorial.’ Yes, that may be right: those may be roughly the parameters, and regrettable; but the interest itself may still be more complete and human—still carry more of human possibility and compassion—than interests uncontaminated by any such affect or compulsion.”

Perhaps this is why psychologist D. W. Winnicott’s notion of “feeling real” is so moving to me. One can aspire to feel real, one can help others to feel real, and one can oneself feel real—a feeling Winnicott describes as the collected, primary sensation of aliveness, “the aliveness of the body tissues and working of body-functions, including the heart’s action and breathing,” which makes spontaneous gesture possible. For Winnicott, feeling real is not reactive to external stimuli, nor is it an identity. It is a sensation—a sensation that spreads. Among other things, it makes one want to live.

There’s something truly strange about living in a historical moment in which the conservative anxiety and despair about queers bringing down civilization and its institutions (marriage, most notably) is met by the anxiety and despair so many queers feel about the failure or incapacity of queerness to bring down civilization and its institutions, and their frustration with the assimilationist, unthinkingly neoliberal bent of the mainstream GLBTQ+ movement, which has spent fine coin begging entrance into two historically repressive structures: marriage and the military. “I’m not the kind of faggot who wants to put a rainbow sticker on a machine gun,” declares poet CAConrad. If there’s one thing homonormativity reveals, it’s the troubling fact that you can be victimized and in no way be radical; it happens very often among homosexuals as with every other oppressed minority.

We each anguished differently and severely: you wanted to give her the care she’d once given to you, but could see it was breaking our new household to try; she was sick and broke and terrified, utterly unwilling or unable to discuss her condition or her options. Eventually I, villainous, drew a line; I couldn’t live this way. She chose to go back to her condo in the suburbs of Detroit and decline alone rather than accept the substandard care of a Medicaid facility near us—all her assets liquidated, a TV blaring from behind a neighbor’s canvas curtain, nurses whispering about accepting Christ as your personal savior, you know the place.

Most people live their entire lives with their clothes on, and even if they wanted to, couldn’t take them off. Then there are those who cannot put them on. They are the ones who live their lives not just as people but as examples of people. They are destined to expose every part of themselves, so the rest of us can know what it means to be a human. Most people lead their private lives. They have been given a natural modesty that feels to them like morality, but it’s not—it’s luck. They shake their heads at the people with their clothes off rather than learning about human life from their example, but they are wrong to act so superior. Some of us have to be naked, so the rest can be exempted by fate.

Or it’s like in The Little Prince—when the prince asks the narrator to draw him a sheep. The narrator tries and tries again, but each time he fails to do it as well as he wishes. He believes himself to be a great artist and cannot understand why it’s not working. In a fit of frustration, he instead draws a box—something he can do well. When the prince asks how it’s a picture of a sheep, the narrator replies that it’s a picture of a sheep in a box. He is arrogantly proud of his solution and satisfied with his efforts. This response is typical of all puers. Such people will suddenly tell you they have another plan, and they always do it the moment things start getting difficult. But it’s their everlasting switching that’s the dangerous thing, not what they choose.

However, the prejudice against the use of consciousness-opening plants and drugs has the major part of its origin in racial intolerance and the accumulation of political power. In the latter part of the last century, once the Intercontinental Railway had been built and the Chinese laborers were no longer needed, they were increasingly portrayed as subhuman and uncivilized; they were yellow-skinned, slant-eyed, dangerous aliens who frequented opium dens. Peyote was described, in various publications of the late 19th century, as the cause of murder, mayhem and insanity among the shiftless Ameri- can Indians.

Milgrim, who hadn’t heard Russian since leaving Basel, felt a peculiar enchantment, in spite of the sullen presence of their guard, and the handrail in his back. The elevator stopped, the door opened, and a tall Parisian teenager stepped in. As the door closed, Milgrim noted the guard’s focus on the girl, no less sullen but absolute. Slender, brunette, she looked from Milgrim to the two Russian women with a sort of benign disdain, ignoring the guard.

“It’s not about being cool,” I told him. “It’s about just being. De Niro was just being; I can never do that now.” Greg stopped in the middle of the pavement and turned to face me. “Do you think you could before?” he asked. “Do you think I can? Do you think that anyone outside of films lights cigarettes or opens fridge doors like that? Think about it: the lighter doesn’t spark first time you flip it, the first wisp of smoke gets in your eye and makes you wince; the fridge door catches and then rattles, milk slops over. It happens to everyone. It’s universal: everything fucks up! You’re not unusual. You know what you are?” “No,” I said. “What?” “You’re just more usual than everyone else.” I thought about that for a long time afterwards, that conversation. I decided Greg was right. I’d always been inauthentic. Even before the accident, if I’d been walking down the street just like De Niro, smoking a cigarette like him, and even if it had lit first try, I’d still be thinking: Here I am, walking down the street, smoking a cigarette, like someone in a film.

During lessons at our college, however, students will be found slumped on desk, talking almost constantly, snacking incessantly (or even, on occasions, eating full meals). The old disciplinary segmentation of time is breaking down. The carceral regime of discipline is being eroded by the technologies of control, with their systems of perpetual consumption and continuous development.

It demands leaps of faith, but it rewards the believer with a sense of consequence. Moreover, just as churches and other ritualistic meeting places serve a social function, so art events generate a sense of community around shared interests. Eric Banks, a writer-editor who appears in Chapter 5, argues that the fervent sociality of the art world has unexpected benefits. “People really do talk about the art they see,” he said. “If I’m reading something by, say, Roberto Bolaño, I’ll find very few people to discuss it with. Reading takes a long time and it’s solitary, whereas art fosters quick-forming imagined communities.”

as "primary repression" means precisely that: it is not a "countercathexis," but rather this repulsion of desiring-machines by the body without organs. This is the real meaning of the paranoiac machine: the desiring-machines attempt to break into the body without organs, and the body without organs repels them, since it experiences them as an over-all persecution apparatus. Thus we cannot agree with Victor Tausk when he regards the paranoiac machine as a mere projection of."a ~erson's.own bodY~' and the genital organs. " The genesis of the machine lies precisely here

Some may wonder how Navy SEAL combat leadership principles translate outside the military realm to leading any team in any capacity. But combat is reflective of life, only amplified and intensified. Decisions have immediate consequences, and everything—absolutely everything—is at stake. The right decision, even when all seems lost, can snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. The wrong decision, even when a victorious outcome seems all but certain, can result in deadly, catastrophic failure. In that regard, a combat leader can acquire a lifetime of leadership lessons learned in only a few deployments.

Hedge-fund managers are relatively new arrivals to the art world, so some worry that they might be acquiring art as if it were stock in order to turn a profit. Others argue that they’re above it; hardworking billionaires have no need to make a few million on art. “What starts them collecting is a curiosity for a life fully lived,” says Heller. “And nowadays, in America, it’s what you do if you have money, just like it has been for decades for Europeans.”

Yet there is nothing very remarkable about these characters. Turgenev complained that they were all mediocrities, and in a sense he was right. They are ordinary men and women.

Modern art wanted to purify the image of everything exterior to it, to render the image autonomous and self-suffcient—but in so doing only affrmed the dominant iconophilia. Thus iconoclasm has become subordinate to iconophilia: the symbolic martyrdom of the image only strengthens our belief in it.

And that is precisely the point at which the documentation becomes indispensable, producing the life of the living thing as such: the documentation inscribes the existence of an object in history, gives a lifespan to this existence, and gives the object life as such—independently of whether this object was “originally” living or artifcial. The difference between the living and the artifcial is, then, exclusively a narrative difference. It cannot be observed but only told, only documented: an object can be given a prehistory, a genesis, an origin by means of narrative. The technical documentation is, incidentally, never constructed as history but always as a system of instructions for producing particular objects under given circumstances. The artistic documentation, whether real or fctive, is, by contrast, primarily narrative, and thus it evokes the unrepeatability of living time. The artifcial can thus be made living, made natural, by means of art documentation, by narrating the history of its origin, its “making.” Art documentation is thus the art of making living things out of artifcial ones, a living activity out of technical practice: it is a bio-art that is simultaneously biopolitics. This basic function of art documentation was strikingly demonstrated by Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner. In the flm, the artifcially produced humans, called “replicants,” are given photographic documentation at the time they are produced, which is supposed to certify their “natural origin”—faked photographs of their family, residences, and so on. Although this documentation is fctive, it gives the replicants life—subjectivity—which makes them indistinguishable from the “natural” human beings on the “inside” as well as on the outside. Because the replicants are inscribed in life, in history, by means of this documentation, they can continue this life in an uninterrupted and thoroughly individual way. Consequently, the hero’s search for a “real,” objectively determinable distinction between the natural and the artifcial ultimately proves to be futile, because, as we have seen, this distinction can be established only through an artistically documented narrative. The fact that life is something that can be documented but not immediately experienced is not a new discovery. One could even claim that this is the defnition of life: life can be documented but not shown. In his book 56 57

Benjamin himself calls attention to this possibility when he writes about the fgure of profane illumination and refers to the forms of life that can lead to such a profane illumination: “The reader, the thinker, the loiterer, the f âneur, are types of illuminati just as much as the opium eater, the dreamer, the ecstatic.”9 One is struck by the fact that these fgures of profane illumination are also fgures of motion— especially the f âneur. The f âneur does not demand of things that they come to him; he goes to things. In this sense, the f âneur does not destroy the auras of things; he respects them. Or rather, only through him does the aura emerge again. The fgure of profane illumination is the reversal of the “loss of aura” that comes from siting the copy in a topology of undetermined circulation though the modern mass media.

Far from it, for it is the images of wreckage and destruction themselves that serve as the icons of new values. In the eyes of the avant-garde the iconoclastic gesture represents an artistic device, deployed less as a means of destroying old icons than as a way to generate new images—or, indeed, new icons.

That further means: A digital image, to be seen, should not be merely exhibited but staged, performed. Here the image begins to function analogously to a piece of music, whose score, as is generally known, is not identical to the musical piece—the score itself being silent. For music to resound, it has to be performed. Thus one can say that digitalization turns the visual arts into a performing art. But to perform something is to interpret it, to betray it, to distort it. Every performance is an interpretation and every interpretation is a betrayal, a misuse. The situation is especially diffcult in the case of the invisible original: If the original is visible it can be compared to a copy—so the copy can be corrected and the feeling of betrayal reduced. But if the original is invisible no such comparison is possible—any visualization remains uncertain. Here the fgure of the curator arises again—and it becomes even more powerful than it was before, because the curator becomes now not only the exhibitor but the performer of the image. The curator does not simply show an image that was originally there but not seen. Rather, the contemporary curator turns the invisible into the visible. By doing so the curator makes choices that modify the performed image in a substantial way. The curator does this frst of all by selecting the technology that should be used to visualize the image data. The information technology is constantly changing nowadays—hardware, software—simply everything is in fux. Because of this the image is already transformed with every act of visualization using a different, new technology. Today’s technology thinks in terms of generations—we speak of computer generations, of generations of photographic and video equipment.

As such a site the museum differs from any other site primarily in its design, in its architecture. It is no coincidence that in recent years attention has shifted from the museum collection to museum architecture. Nevertheless, the museum today has not abandoned entirely its promise of profane immortality. The art documentation that is collected in museums and other art institutions can always be exhibited anew as art. This distinguishes the art projects collected in museums from the life projects documented in other archives: realizing art as art means exhibiting it. And the museum can do that. It is, admittedly, possible to present a life project anew in a reality outside the museum, but only if it itself ultimately concerns an artistic project. This kind of rediscovery of art documentation is, however, only possible because it continues the focus on multiple authorship. Old art documents are restored, transferred to other media, rearranged, installed, and presented in other spaces. Under such conditions it is meaningless to speak of an individual, intact authorship. The artwork as exhibited art documentation is kept alive because its multiple authorships continue to multiply and proliferate; and the site of this proliferation and multiplication of authorship is the present-day museum. The transformation of the artwork into art documentation by means of its own archiving also enables art today to draw on, in an artistic context, the immense reservoir of documentation of other events and projects that our civilization has collected. And indeed the formulation and documentation of various projects is the main activity of modern man. Whatever one wishes to undertake in business, politics, or culture, the frst thing that must be done is to formulate a corresponding project in order to present an application for the approval or fnancing of this project to one or more responsible authorities.

As such a site the museum differs from any other site primarily in its design, in its architecture. It is no coincidence that in recent years attention has shifted from the museum collection to museum architecture. Nevertheless, the museum today has not abandoned entirely its promise of profane immortality. The art documentation that is collected in museums and other art institutions can always be exhibited anew as art. This distinguishes the art projects collected in museums from the life projects documented in other archives: realizing art as art means exhibiting it. And the museum can do that. It is, admittedly, possible to present a life project anew in a reality outside the museum, but only if it itself ultimately concerns an artistic project. This kind of rediscovery of art documentation is, however, only possible because it continues the focus on multiple authorship.

Frequently, however, many of the project proposals that our civilization is constantly producing are lost or simply thrown away after they are rejected. This careless approach to the art form of the project formulation is quite regrettable, really, because it often prevents us from analyzing and understanding the hopes and visions of the future that are invested in these proposals, and these things can say more about our society than anything else

This fact prompts the widespread outcry that all cities now increasingly resemble one another and are beginning to homogenize, with the result that when a tourist arrives in a new city he ends up seeing the same things he encountered in all the other cities. This experience of similarity among all contemporary cities often misleads the observer to assume that the globalization process is erasing local cultural idiosyncrasies, identities, and differences. The truth is not that these distinctions have disappeared, but that they in turn have also embarked on a journey, started to reproduce themselves and to expand. For quite a while now we have been able to enjoy the delights of Chinese cooking not only in China, but also in New York, Paris, and Dortmund. On speculating in which cultural surroundings Chinese food tastes best, the answer is not necessarily “China.” If we go to China today and fail to experience Chinese cities as being exotic, this is by no means simply because 104 105

The avant-garde art discourse makes use of many concepts from the military sphere, including the notion of the avant-garde itself. There is talk of exploding norms, destroying traditions, violating taboos, practicing certain artistic strategies, attacking the existing institutions, and the like. From this we can see that not only does modern art go along with, illustrate, laud, or criticize war as it did earlier, but also wages war itself. The artists of the classical avant-garde saw themselves as agents of negation, destruction, eradication of all traditional forms of art. In accordance with the famous dictum “negation is creation,” which was inspired by the Hegelian dialectic and propagated by authors such as Bakunin and Nietzsche under the title of “active nihilism,” avant-garde artists felt themselves empowered to create new icons through destruction of the old ones. A modern work of art was measured by how radical it was, how far the artist had gone in destroying artistic tradition. Although in the meanwhile the modernity itself has often enough been declared passé, to this very day this criterion of radicalness has lost nothing of its relevance to our evaluation of art. The worst thing that can be said of an artist continues to be that his or her art is “harmless.” This means that modern art has a more than ambivalent relationship with violence, with terrorism. An artist’s negative reaction to repressive, stateorganized power is something that almost goes without saying. Artists who are committed to the tradition of modernity will feel themselves unambiguously compelled by this tradition to defend the individual’s sovereignty against state oppression. But the artist’s attitude toward individual and revolutionary violence is more complicated, insofar as it also practices a radical affrmation of the individual’s sovereignty over the state. There is a long history behind the profound inner complicity between modern art and modern revolutionary, individual violence. In both cases, radical negation is equated with authentic creativity, whether in the area of art or politics. Over and over again this complicity results in a form of rivalry. 122 123

Soviet culture as a whole may therefore be understood as an attempt to abolish that split between the avant-garde and mass culture that Greenberg diagnosed as the main effect of art operating under the conditions of Western-style capitalism.7 Accordingly, all other oppositions related to this fundamental opposition—between production and reproduction, original and copy, quality and quantity, for instance—lost their relevance in the framework of Soviet culture. The primary interest of Socialist Realism was not an artwork but a viewer. Soviet art was produced in the relatively frm conviction that people would come to like it when they had become better people, less decadent and less corrupted by bourgeois values.

As I have tried to show, radical politics cannot be dissociated from a certain aesthetic taste—the taste for the universal, for the degree zero of diversity. On the other hand, liberal, marketoriented politics is correlated with the preference for diversity, difference, openness, and heterogeneity. Today, the postmodern taste still prevails. Radical political projects have almost no chance today of being accepted by the public because they do not correlate with the dominant aesthetic sensibility. But the times are changing. And it is very possible that in the near future a new sensibility for radical art and politics will emerge again. 162 163

The tendency in politics to treat art as one of the pretty irrelevancies and to ignore its political relevance is well known. This tendency has even signifcantly increased today, which is especially implausible, because we now live in a time in which most information is communicated by visual means, including political information. Precisely in connection with the debates over political Islam, which have become acute recently, the role of the visual has increased. Politically explosive problems are ignited almost exclusively by images: Danish cartoons, women behind veils, videos of bin Laden. Islamic fundamentalists address the outside world primarily through the medium of video—despite Islam’s supposed hostility to images. But even a much simpler example demonstrates what it is about today: When the question of multiculturalism is discussed on the TV, the visual is inevitably of a street in a European city dominated by passers-by whose skin color differs from that of the “original” European population. This gives the impression that culture here functions de facto as a pseudonym for race. As a result, simply transferring a certain discourse into the visual makes it racist—even if that is not explicitly intended. Thus the dependence of today’s politics on the images with which it operates is obvious. It is part of the traditional repertoire of European art to depict oneself as a dangerous, cruel alien. Thus Nietzsche presented himself as an envoy of the Übermensch and Bataille as a champion of cruel Aztec rituals. This tradition of presenting oneself as an evil outsider began at the very latest with Marquis de Sade and developed during black Romanticism and its cult of the satanic into one of the major traditions of European art. And it was not always restricted to art. Already in the nineteenth century there were many artists and intellectuals who not only had sympathies with terrorism but actively 178 179

The underestimation in our time of the effect of art on the public consciousness is related above all to the fact that art is identifed frst and foremost as the art market and the work of art as a commodity. The fact that art functions in the context of the art market and that every work of art is a commodity is beyond doubt. The work of art is, however, not just a commodity but also a statement in public space. Art is also made and exhibited for those who do not wish to purchase it—indeed, they constitute the overwhelming majority of the audience for art

And it is becoming part of mass culture not as the production of individual objects that are traded on the art market but as an exhibition praxis that combines architecture, design, and fashion—just as the guiding intellectual fgures of the avant-garde, such as the artists from Bauhaus, Vkhutemas, and others had predicted as early as the 1920s and 1930s. But does that mean that art today has become completely identical with mass culture and has completely lost its ability to transcend its boundaries and thus to refect on itself ? I do not believe so. Mass culture—or let’s call it entertainment—has a dimension that is often overlooked but is extremely relevant to the problems of otherness or alienness. Mass culture addresses everyone simultaneously. A pop concert or flm screening creates communities of viewers. These communities are transitory; their members do not know one another; their composition is arbitrary; it remains unclear where all these people came from and where they are going; they have little or nothing to say to one another; they lack a shared identity, a common prehistory that could have produced common memories they could share—and despite all that they are communities. These communities recall the communities of those traveling on a train or airplane. To put it another way, they are radically contemporary communities—much more contemporary than religious communities, political communities, or labor collectives. All those traditional communities emerged historically and presume that their members are linked to one another from the outset by something that derives from their shared past—a shared language, a shared faith, a shared political belief, a shared education that enables them to do a certain job. Such communities always have specifc boundaries—and they close themselves off from all those with whom they have no shared past. Mass culture, by contrast, creates communities irrespective of any shared past—communities with no preconditions, communities of a new type. This is the source of their enormous potential for modernization, which is so often overlooked. But mass culture itself is usually not capable of refecting on and developing this potential fully, because the communities it creates 180 181

With the rise of the Web, writing has met its photography. By that, I mean that writing has encountered a situation similar to that of painting upon the invention of photography, a technology so much better at doing what the art form had been trying to do that, to survive, the field had to alter its course radically. If photography was striving for sharp focus, painting was forced to go soft, hence impressionism. Faced with an unprecedented amount of available digital text, writing needs to redefine itself to adapt to the new environment of textual abundance.

That the separation of form and function, of concept and execution, is not likely to produce objects of esthetic value has been repeatedly demonstrated. Similarly, it has been shown that the system which regards esthetics as irrelevant, which separates the artist from his product, which fragments the work of the individual, which creates by committee, and which makes mincemeat of the creative process will, in the long run, diminish not only the product but the maker as well.

However, for an advertisement to hold its own in a competitive race, the designer must steer clear of visual clichés by some unexpected interpretation of the commonplace. He does this partly by simplifying, by abstracting, by symbolizing. If the resulting visual image is in any way ambiguous, it may be supplemented by one which is more clearly recognizable.

production. We intend such a parallel to be regarded as merely phenomenological: we are here drawing no conclusions whatsoever as to the nature and the relationship of the two productions, nor does the parallel we are about to establish provide any sort of a priori answer to the question whether desiring-production and social production are really two separate and distinct productions. Its one purpose is to point out the fact that the forms of social production, like those of desiring-production, involve an unengendered nonproductive attitude, an element of antiproduction coupled with the process, a full body that functions as a socius. This socius may be the body of the earth, that of the tyrant, or capital. This is the body that Marx is referring to when he says that it is not the product of labor, but rather appears as its natural or divine presupposition. In fact, it does not restrict itself merely to opposing productive forces in and of themselves. It falls back on (il se rabat sur)* all production, constituting a surface over which the forces and agents of production are distributed, thereby appropriating for itself all surplus production and arrogating to itself both the whole and the parts of the process, which now seem to emanate from it as a quasi cause. Forces and agents come to represent a miraculous form of its own power: they appear to be "miraculated" (miracules) by it. In a word, the socius as a full body forms a surface where all production is recorded, whereupon the entire process appears to emanate from this recording surface. Society constructs its own delirium by recording the process of production; but it is not a conscious delirium, or rather is a true consciousness of a false movement, a true perception of an apparent objective movement, a true perception of the movement that is produced on the recording surface. Capital is indeed the body without organs of the capitalist, or rather of the capitalist being. But as such, it is not only the fluid and petrified substance of money, for it will give to the sterility of money the form whereby money produces money. It produces surplus value, just as the body without organs reproduces itself, puts forth shoots, and branches out to the farthest corners of the universe. It makes the machine responsible for producing a relative surplus value, while embodying itself in the machine as fixed capital. Machines and agents cling so *The verb se rabattre sur (and the noun rebattemenl), used by the authors here and in numerous instances in the text below, has several different connotations, as lor instance: in descriptive geometry, to describe the rotation of a plane so as to coincide with another plane, usually followed by a reverse rotation back into its original position; a retreat to a previously held position, as in a battle; and a reduction to a lower level.

Desire is not bolstered by needs, but rather the contrary; needs are derived from desire: they are counterproducts within the real that desire produces. Lack is a countereffect of desire; it is deposited, distributed, vacuolized within a real that is natural and social. Desire always remains in close touch with the conditions of objective existence; it embraces them and follows them, shifts when they shift, and does not outlive them. For that reason it so often becomes the desire to die, whereas need is a measure of the withdrawal of a subject that has lost its desire at the same time that it loses the passive syntheses of these conditions. This is precisely the significance of need as a search in a void: hunting about, trying to capture or become a parasite of passive syntheses in whatever vague world they may happen to exist in. It is no use saying: We are not green plants; we have long since been unable to synthesize chlorophyll, so it's necessary to eat. ... Desire then becomes this abject fear of lacking something. But it should be noted that this is not a phrase uttered by the poor or the dispossessed. On the contrary, such people know that they are close to grass, almost akin to it, and that desire "needs" very few things-not those leftovers that chance to come their way, but the very things that are continually taken from them-and that what is missing is not things a subject feels the lack of somewhere deep down inside himself, but rather the objectivity of man, the objective being of man, for whom to desire is to produce, to produce within the realm of the real. The real is not impossible; on the contrary, within the real everything is possible, everything becomes possible. Desire does not express a molar lack within the subject; rather, the molar organization deprives desire of its objective being. Revolutionaries, artists, and seers are content to be objective, merely objective: they know that desire clasps life in its powerfully productive embrace, and reproduces it in a way that is all the more intense because it has few needs. And never mind those who believe that this is very easy to say, or that it is the sort of idea to be found in books. "From the little reading I had done I had observed that the men who were most in life, who were moulding life, who were life itself, ate little, slept little, owned little or nothing.

The pervert is someone who takes the artifice seriously and plays the game to the hilt: if you want them, you can have them-territorialities infinitely more artificial than the ones that society offers us, totally artificial new families, secret lunar societies. As for the schizo, continually wandering about, migrating here, there, and everywhere as best he can, he plunges further and further into the realm of deterritorialization, reaching the furthest limits of the decomposition of the socius on the surface of his own body without organs. It may well be that these peregrinations are the schizo's own particular way of rediscovering the earth. The schizophrenic deliberately seeks out the very limit of capitalism: he is its inherent tendency brought to fulfillment, its surplus product, its proletariat, and its exterminating angel. He scrambles all the codes and is the transmitter of the decoded flows of desire. The real continues to flow. In the schizo, the two aspects ofprocess are conjoined: the metaphysical process that puts us in contact with the "demoniacal" element in nature or within the heart of the earth, and the historical process of social production that restores the autonomy of desiring-machines in relation to the deterritori-alized social machine. Schizophrenia is desiring-production as the limit of social production. Desiring-production, and its difference in regime as compared to social production, are thus end points, not points of departure. Between the two there is nothing but an ongoing process of becoming that is the becoming of reality. And if materialist psychiatry may be defined as the psychiatry that introduces the concept of production into consideration of the problem of desire, it cannot avoid posing in eschatological terms the problem of the ultimate relationship between the analytic machine, the revolutionary machine, and desiring-machines.

moment ago that the schizo is at the very limit of the decoded flows of desire, we meant that he was at the very limit of the social codes, where a despotic Signifier destroys all the chains, linearizes them, biunivocalizes them, and uses the bricks as so many immobile units for the construction of an imperial Great Wall of China. But the schizo continually detaches them, continually works them loose and carries them off in every direction in order to create a new polyvocity that is the code of desire. Every composition, and also every decomposition, uses mobile bricks as the basic unit. Diaschisis and diaspasis, as Monakow put it: either a lesion spreads along fibers that link it to other regions and thus gives rise at a distance to phenomena that are incomprehensible from a purely mechanistic (but not a machinic) point of view; or else a humoral disturbance brings on a shift in nervous energy and creates broken, fragmented paths within the sphere of instincts. These bricks or blocks are the essential parts of desiring-machines from the point of view of the recording process: they are at once component parts and products of the process of decomposition that are spatially localized only at certain moments, by contrast with the nervous system, which is a great chronogeneous machine: a melody-producing machine of the "music box" type, with a nonspatiallocalization.35 What makes Monakow and Mourgue's study an unparalleled one, going far beyond the entire Jacksonist philosophy that originally inspired it, is the theory of bricks or blocks, their detachment and fragmentation, and above all what such a theory presupposes: the introduction of desire into neurology. The third type of interruption or break characteristic of the desiring-machine is the residual break (coupure-reste) or residuum, which produces a subject alongside the machine, functioning as a part adjacent to the machine. And if this subject has no specific or personal identity, if it traverses the body without organs without destroying its indifference, it is because it is not only a part that is peripheral to the machine, but also a part that is itself divided into parts that corres- 40 ANTI-OEDIPUS

The novelty of cenoby is that, by taking literally the Pauline prescription of unceasing prayer (adialeiptōs proseuchesthe; 1 Thess. 5:17), it transforms the whole of life into an Office by way of temporal scansion. Confronted with this apostolic precept, the patristic tradition had drawn the consequence from it that Origen sums up in his De oratione, namely, that the only possible way to understand this precept is that “the entire life of the saint taken as a whole is a single great prayer, [and] prayer in the ordinary sense ought to be made no less than three times each day” (Origen, De oratione 12.1).

One could not more clearly express the fact that the monastic ideal is that of a total mobilization of existence through time.

The spiritualization of the work of the hands that is accomplished in this way can be seen as a significant precursor of the Protestant ascesis of labor, of which capitalism, according to Max Weber, represents the secularization. And if the Christian liturgy, which culminates in the creation of the liturgical year and the cursus horarum, has been effectively defined as a “sanctification of time,” in which every day and every hour is constituted as a “memorial of the works of God and the mysteries of Christ” (Righetti, p. 1), the cenobitic project can on the contrary be defined more precisely as a sanctification of life by means of time.

In this sense, the monastery is perhaps the first place in which life itself—and not only the ascetic techniques that form and regulate it—was presented as an art. This analogy must not be understood, however, in the sense of an aestheticization of existence, but rather in the sense that Michel Foucault seemed to have in mind in his last writings, namely a definition of life itself in relation to a never-ending practice.

ceasing to be differences. We are statistically or molarly heterosexual, but personally homosexual, without knowing it or being fully aware of it, and finally we are transsexual in an elemental, molecular sense. That is why Proust, the first to deny all oedipalizing interpretations of his own interpretations, contrasts two kinds of homosexuality, or rather two regions only one of which is Oedipal, exclusive, and depressive, the other being anoedipal schizoid, included, and inclusive: "For some, doubtless those whose childhoods were timid, the material kind of pleasure they take does not matter, so long as they can relate it to a male countenance. While others, whose sensuality is doubtless more violent, give their material pleasure certain imperious localizations. The second group would shock most people by their avowals. They live perhaps less exclusively under Saturn's satellite, for in their case women are not entirely excluded.... But those in the second group seek out women who prefer women, women who suggest young men ... indeed, they can take, with such women, the same pleasure as with a man.... For in their relations with women, they play-for the woman who prefers women-the role of another woman, and at the same time a woman offers them approximately what they find in a man. "15 The opposition here is between two uses of the connective syntheses: a global and specific use, and a partial and nonspecific use. In the first, desire at the same time receives a fixed subject, an ego specified according to a given sex, and complete objects defined as global persons. The complexity and the foundations of such an operation appear more distinctly if we consider the mutual reactions between the different syntheses of the unconscious following a given use. It is first of all the synthesis of recording that in effect situates, on its surface of inscription within the conditions of Oedipus, a definable and differentiable ego in relation to parental images serving as co-ordinates (mother, father). There we have a triangulation that implies in its essence a constituent prohibition, and that conditions the differentiation between persons: prohibition of incest with the mother, prohibition against taking the father's place. But a strange sort of reasoning leads one to conclude that, since it is forbidden, that very thing was desired. In reality, global persons-even the very form of persons-do not exist prior to the prohibitions that weigh on them and constitute them, any more than they exist prior to the triangulation into which they enter: desire receives its first complete objects and is forbidden them at one and the same time. Therefore it is indeed the same Oedipal operation that lays the foundations for the possibility of its own "resolution," by way of a differentia- 70 ANTi-OEDIPUS

Just as in the syntagmas regula iuris and regula fidei, law and faith are not directed by the rule or derived from it, but vice versa, in the same way it is possible that in the syntagma regula vitae it is not so much the form of life that is to be derived from the rule as the rule from the form of life. Or perhaps it should rather be said that the movement goes in both directions and that, in the incessant tension toward the realization of a threshold of indifference, the rule is made life to the same extent that life is made rule.

In the words of Bonagratia, sicut equus habet usus facti, “as the horse has de facto use but not property rights over the oats that it eats, so the religious who has abdicated all property has the simple de facto use [usum simplicem facti] of bread, wine, and clothes” (Bonagratia, p. 511). From the perspective that is of interest to us here, Franciscanism can be defined—and in this consists its novelty, even today unthought, and in the present conditions of society, totally unthinkable—as the attempt to realize a human life and practice absolutely outside the determinations of the law.

The preoccupation with constructing a justification of use in juridical terms prevented them from collecting the hints of a theory of use present in the Pauline letters, in particular in 1 Corinthians 7:20–31, in which using the world as not using it or not abusing it (et qui utuntur hoc mundo, tamquam non utantur; the original Greek hōs mē katachromenoi means “as not abusing”) defined the Christian’s form of life.

She always reconducted him to the first step of the stairs. When his horse had not yet been brought round she stayed there. They had said, “Good-bye”; there was no more talking. The open air wrapped her round, playing with the soft down on the back of her neck, or blew to and fro on her hips her apron-strings, that fluttered like streamers. Once, during a thaw, the bark of the trees in the yard was oozing, the snow on the roofs of the out-buildings was melting; she stood on the threshold, and went to fetch her sunshade and opened it. The sunshade, of silk of the colour of pigeons’ breasts, through which the sun shone, lighted up with shifting hues the white skin of her face. She smiled under the tender warmth, and drops of water could be heard falling one by one on the stretched silk.

When all was over at the cemetery Charles went home.

She had loved him after all.

When he had gone about a hundred paces he stopped, and as he saw the cart disappearing, its wheels turning in the dust, he gave a deep sigh. Then he remembered his wedding, the old times, the first pregnancy of his wife; he, too, had been very happy the day when he had taken her from her father to his home, and had carried her off on a pillion, trotting through the snow, for it was near Christmas-time; and the country was all white. She held him by one arm, her basket hanging from the other; the wind blew the long lace of her Cauchois head-dress so that it sometimes flapped across his mouth, and when he turned his head he saw near him, on his shoulder, her little rosy face, smiling silently under the gold bands of her cap. To warm her hands she put them from time to time in his breast. How long ago it all was! Their son would have been thirty by now. Then he looked back and saw nothing on the road.

A shell-box adorned the chest of drawers, and on the secretary near the window a bouquet of orange blossoms tied with white satin ribbons stood in a bottle. It was a bride’s bouquet; it was the other one’s. She looked at it. Charles noticed it; he took it and carried it up to the attic, while Emma seated in an armchair (they were putting her things down around her) thought of her bridal flowers packed up in a bandbox, and wondered, dreaming, what would be done with them if she were to die.

Those who were beginning to grow old had an air of youth, while there was something mature in the faces of the young. In their unconcerned looks was the calm of passions daily satiated, and through all their gentleness of manner pierced that peculiar brutality, the result of a command of half-easy things, in which force is exercised and vanity amused—the management of thoroughbred horses and the society of loose women.

Love, she thought, must come suddenly, with great outbursts and light nings,—a hurricane of the skies, which falls upon life, revolutionises it, roots up the will like a leaf, and sweeps the whole heart into the abyss.

Sometimes I wondered if there was a correlation between Peter always buying himself the crappy stuff and him choosing me: a thrifty, generic brown one, instead of name-brand white one with blond hair. He had rummaged through the bin and said, “This brown one will do. It has all the same parts as the white one.” He liked things that were a little damaged or messed up. It gave him some kind of weird thrill. He mistook damage for having character.

“Madame Bovary, c‘est moi,” Flaubert famously stated when his book was a hit and he was hounded by critics and fans to identify the real-life, verité source of his character. Yet he also liked saying the opposite: “There’s nothing in Madame Bovary that’s drawn from life,” he wrote to Mlle. Leroyer de Chantepie in a letter dated March 18, 1857. “It’s a completely invented story. None of my own feelings or experiences are in it.” And yet Flaubert also wrote, in his youth, “There are days when one would like to be an athlete, and others when one longs to be a woman. In the first case it is because our muscles are aquiver; in the second, because our flesh is yearning and ablaze” (Intimate Notebook, p. 47).

Students should have to develop fully thought-out written proposals before, during, and after painting and sculpting. I don’t mean that they should do this simply to defend an image or object during individual and group critiques, as students have always done, but to learn how to justify that creation intellectually, beyond the subjective, in our visually dense and materially cluttered world. If they don’t want to do this, they have no business being professional contemporary artists. They should be doctors and lawyers who paint on Sunday, or they should be the fne two-dimensional technicians who paint for Jef Koons. We are all creative; creativity is part of the human condition.However, not everyone is a cultural producer. Our art schools’ counseling departments should be sharper in vocational counseling.

Listen to the great paranoiac din beneath the discourse of reason that speaks for others, in the name of the silent majority. The explanation is that, beneath preconscious goals and interests, a uniquely unconscious investment rises up that embraces a full body for itself, independently of all aims, and a degree of development for itself, independently of all reason: that very degree and no other, don't take another step; that very socius and no other, hands off. A disinterested love of the molar machine, a veritable enjoyment, with all the hatred it contains for those who do not submit to the molar machine: the entire libido is at stake

Even the most overt fascism speaks the language of goals, of law, order, and reason. Even the most insane capitalism speaks in the name of economic rationality. And this is necessarily the case, since it is in the irrationality of the full body that the order of reasons is inextricably fixed, under a code, under an axiomatic that determines it. What is more, the bringing to light of the unconscious reactionary investment as if devoid of an aim, would be enough to transform it completely, to make it pass to the other pole of the libido, i.e., to the schizorevolutionary pole, since this

He screamed Connell’s name, and began to kiss his head with wild exuberant kisses. It was only one-all, and there were still twenty minutes left on the clock. But that was their world then. Their feelings were suppressed so carefully in everyday life, forced into smaller and smaller spaces, until seemingly minor events took on insane and frightening significance. It was permissible to touch each other and cry during football matches.

Marianne is a masochist and Connell is simply too nice of a guy to hit a woman. This, after all, is the literal level on which the incident took place. She asked him to hit her and when he said he didn’t want to, she wanted to stop having sex. So why, despite its factual accuracy, does this feel like a dishonest way of narrating what happened? What is the missing element, the excluded part of the story that explains what upset them both? It has something to do with their history, he knows that. Ever since school he has understood his power over her. How she responds to his look or the touch of his hand. The way her face colours, and she goes still as if awaiting some spoken order. His effortless tyranny over someone who seems, to other people, so invulnerable.

Perhaps ours is not a world of information but a wall of noise, a screeching mélange of incompatible equations into which we have no real choice but to enter into directly: scrambled territories, institutions, constitutions, sovereignties, citizenships, hardwares, softwares, protocols, interfaces, databases, patterns, platforms, cities, muscles, skins, organs, failing presumptions, exotic refrains, domains, settlements, penultimate boundaries—or, better yet, directly into the forms-to-come, for which each of these legacies is just an ancestral ante-image. There is less forward and backward than entropy and negentropy, oblivion and not oblivion, imminent or deferred utopia. As such, any design authorship must understand that the dynamics at work now are—for better and worse—simultaneously and interchangeably both futuristic and archaic, at once both technocratic and theocratic.

In starting with and from political theory in this first part, it is important to acknowledge in advance that “sovereignty” is positioned as a question, not as a given conclusion. The implication is not that software is new and sovereignty is timeless, thereby leading one to ask how sovereignty now works through software, but rather that both are now mutually contingent and that the work of software at a global scale itself produces unfamiliar sorts of sovereignties.

He argued that one of the things that makes neoliberalism unique is that markets do not operate in conjunction with or in conflict with sovereign states, but rather that sovereignty is itself shifted from states into markets. For sovereign markets, rights of economic exchange supersede the governance of public order at the level of the individual and the collective.

The Schmittian primal scenes are the plowing of a field, taken and defended, and the state's duty to build good walls around it. These sovereignties over place are materially substantiated by a defended occupation of place that is supposed to outlast the prosthetic logistical visions of Roman surveyors who have come and gone. Two lines: the ox draws its line into the absolute place of this soil, whereas the itinerant emissary of empire superimposes his invisible geometry—one a true fact and the other a temporary mathematical conjecture.

Just as a battle begins in a state of equilibrium between the two sides, which gradually alters one way or the other until it is clear that the balance has tilted so far that the issue can no longer be in doubt--so this gathering of rabbits in the dark, beginning with hesitant approaches, silences, pauses, movements, crouchings side by side and all manner of tentative appraisals, slowly moved, like a hemisphere of the world into summer, to a warmer, brighter region of mutual liking and approval, until all felt sure that they had nothing to fear. Pipkin, some way away from Hazel, crouched at his ease between two huge rabbits who could have broken his back in a second, while Buckthorn and Cowslip started a playful scuffle, nipping each other like kittens and then breaking off to comb their ears in a comical pretense of sudden gravity.

Platforms are formally neutral but remain, each and every one, uniquely “ideological” in how they realize particular strategies for organizing their publics. They are identified with neoliberalism (not without reason), but their origins lie as much within the utopian megastructures of 1960s experimental architecture, counterculture cybernetics, Soviet planning schemes, and many other systems of sociotechnical governance, both realized and imagined. Platforms are infrastructural but rely heavily on aesthetic expression and calibration.

The entwined polar positions of Sunnyvale, Caracas, Beijing, Brussels, Tribeca, and Tel Aviv don't integrate capital and resource markets into network societies on their own, but are themselves “computed” into these arrangements. Either way, it is possible to delineate structural causality between technological and socioeconomic systems only in model abstractions, because one always contains the other and is contained by the other at once.

We cannot, for example, finally locate computation technologies as a base and information culture as a superstructure, bound together either through capital-intensive modes of production and exchange or through computational flows directly determining systems of valuation and exchange in their image. Rather, we could do so, but only with abstractions that are easily turned inside out.

Grosz links the act of framing, however, not to the subtractive competition of natural selection but to the multiplicative energy of sexual selection and its economies of display, expenditure, and abundance. In her Darwinian parable, the animal draws territory with its paw, its wing, or song refrain not only to fend off predators but also to stage itself in the view of a mate. She quotes from Deleuze and Félix Guattari's last collaboration: “Every morning the Scenopoetes dentirostris, a bird of the Australian rain forests, cuts leaves, makes them fall to the ground, and turns them over so that the paler internal side contrasts with the earth. In this way it constructs a stage for itself like a ready-made; and directly above, on a creeper or branch, while fluffing its feathers beneath its beak to reveal their yellow roots, it sings a complex song made up from its own notes and, at intervals, those of other birds that it imitates; it is a complete artist.” Beyond what is needed for survival in the moment, this act of self-framing sets the world in motion with a composition that motivates communion.

In dialogue with the new externalized perspectives of the space age, this was not lost on art and design, and the very early years of planetary computation and global media (approximately 1964 to 1975) saw an explosion of land art, earthworks, and speculative megastructural architecture.

As part of a team commissioned by the European Commission, AMO (the research wing of Koolhaas's OMA architectural studio) proposed a new map of Europe (now “Eneropa”) based on a similar conjecture. In their map, different areas of Europe are redrawn such that Spain, France, and Sweden give way to the new regions of Solaria, the Tidal States, and Geothermia, respectively.66 However, perhaps instead of new federalisms, even discontiguous ones based on energy production, might we see instead see a fragmenting of geographies down into superlocal finely grained bioregional localities linked through the much more nimble sensing and calculating tools now at our disposal?

Without discounting the obvious help that good shelter provides to alleviate the acute misery of such experiences, we must be honest in seeing that accommodating emergency is also how a perhaps illegitimate state of exception is stabilized and over time normalized. If by sponsoring a commission, the perpetrator remains immunized from disruption while the interned and displaced are reformed and reconfigured, then design on behalf of the emergency aids both victims and victimizers.

There are people who think contraception is immoral because the object of copulation is procreation. In a similar way there are people who think the only reason to read a book is to write a book; people should call up books from the dust and the dark and write thousands of words to be sent down to the dust and the dark which can be called up so that other people can send further thousands of words to join them in the dust and the dark. Sometimes a book can be called from the dust and the dark to produce a book which can be bought in shops, and perhaps it is interesting, but the people who buy it and read it because it is interesting are not serious people, if they were serious they would not care about the interest they would be writing thousands of words to consign to the dust and the dark.

As already suggested, a political and cultural momentum toward generalized secession, not one-worldism, seems to drive what we might see as the nomos of the Cloud. As a response to the uncertainties of the Cloud, polities consolidate into enclaves, new and old. Some of these are based on gestures like a reinscription of original lines of ethnic division and self-location, and some are based on platform sovereignties provided or demanded by regular participation in and identification with particular Cloud services, and some are based on both at once.

This very brief text is concerned with the historical transformation of cities from an older “disciplinary” mode, coercing inhabitants into governable mass envelopes such as schools, factories, prisons, office buildings, and barracks, toward a new “control” mode, for which anyone's self-directed movements through open and closed spaces is governed in advance at every interfacial point of passage, as built up parametrically through filtering gateways, point-of-purchase identity verification, and the local geography of entertainment. Control, which Deleuze defines in terms of the addiction-debt-mimicry tropes of William S. Burroughs, normalizes oscillations between the striation and smoothing of urban space and gives real-time shape to social systems convened by the soft cybernetics of interface design. We recognize the city he describes as filled with suspicious responsive environments, from ATM PINs, to key cards and parking permits, e-tickets to branded entertainment, personalized recommendations from others who have purchased similar items, mobile social network transparencies, GPS-enabled monitoring of parolees, and customer phone tracking for retail layout optimization.

Instead of design studios, management consultants—McKinsey, Morgan Stanley and Halliburton to Cisco, Siemens and IBM—are winning the city-making game, and they have rather different design interests in the flows of algorithmic capital and its spastic valuations of land, energy, information, and human capital.

She tuned the radio to NPR. This was the second element of the morning ritual after her stretching. Louis said the English-speaking voices reminded him of morning car rides to school, harkening nostalgically back to a swiftly disappearing kind of neolib Americana. The sound of NPR was a message in a bottle from the homeland, written by someone who would only have had to pay attention to the content of the message to know the medium of its transmission was no longer valid. And yet the voices still carried on in genial two-minute news segments, even now, even here in Europe, reassuring generations of expats that the hegemony of the English language would endure and that at least All Things would still be Considered, whether those things were true or not.

Thereby, any local address no longer comes and goes in the same way. It now leaves a durable marker on the “text” (any site, object, event, person) such that it can be reconstituted later and can be incorporated into a reframed public life of that text. In this case (the one most familiar to the digital humanities), deep address represents a kind of second-order intertextuality, an artificial superimposition of a linking mechanism into techniques of reading, quotation, archiving, analysis, archaeology, and so on.

Because the increase in computational intensity of each node in an opaque global network and of the network's circulatory capacity as a whole helps to produce the radically diminished contiguity of the interfacial landscape, and less transparency of far-flung assemblage lines, a tremendous demand is then placed back on its own images, especially interfacial images, which can represent the totality of these nodes into coherent wholes.

Hackers create the possibility of new things entering the world. Not always great things, or even good things, but new things. In art, in science, in philosophy and culture, in any production of knowledge where data can be gathered, where information can be extracted from it, and where in that information new possibilities for the world produced, there are hackers hacking the new out of the old. While we create these new worlds, we do not possess them. That which we create is mortgaged to others, and to the interests of others, to states and corporations who monopolize the means for making worlds we alone discover. We do not own what we produce—it owns us.

The time is past due when hackers must come together with workers and farmers—with all of the producers of the world—to liberate productive and inventive resources from the myth of scarcity. The time is past due for new forms of association to be created that can steer the world away from its destruction through commodifed exploitation. The greatest hacks of our time may turn out to be forms of organizing free collective expression, so that from this time on, abstraction serves the people, rather than the people serving the ruling class

Foucault's fascination with the function of Islam for the Left, not so much as a model of communitarian equity but simply as a wedge in the door keeping the conceptual possibility of radical political difference from slamming shut, was to see in political Shi’ism a heterological alternative to the cynical European Liberal doxa. It is also a (perhaps more learned) variation on the predictable tendency to romanticize (both positively and negatively) the presumed depth of faith and conviction of jihadists, radicals, and especially suicide bombers.

But on the three or four occasions when distrustful collectors had taken me up on my offer: what the collector didn’t realize was that the fake—passing from his possession to mine, at a price indicative of its apparent worth—had overnight acquired a provenance. Once it was back in my hands, I had a paper trail to show it had been part of the illustrious So-and-So collection.

I myself had come upstairs unexpectedly on the day in question to find a gym-toned, casually dressed mom who looked like she’d just come from a Pilates class slipping a paperweight in her bag. “That’s eight hundred and fifty dollars,” I said, and at my voice she froze and looked up in horror. Actually it was only two fifty, but she handed me her credit card without a word and let me ring up the sale—probably the first profitable transaction that had taken place since Welty’s death; for Hobie’s friends (his main customers) were only too aware that they could talk Hobie down to criminal levels on his already too-low prices.

Sometimes in bed—adrift in my sighing, opiated, erotic reveries—I carried on long candid conversations with her: we are inseparable, I imagined us saying (cornily) to each other, each with a hand on the other’s cheek, we can never be apart.

pupils—not that anybody in Hobie’s crowd seemed to notice, except (sometimes) a few of the younger, more with-it gay guys—“You’re a bad boy,” the bodybuilder boyfriend of a client had whispered into my ear at a formal dinner, freaking me out thoroughly. And I dreaded going up to the Accounts department at one of the auction houses because one of the guys there—older, British, an addict himself—was always hitting on me.

BORIS WAS RIGHT ABOUT his dope, how pure it was—pure white, a normal sized bump knocked me cockeyed, so that for an indeterminate interlude I drifted in and out pleasantly on the verge of death. Cities, centuries. In and out I glided of slow moments, delightful, shades drawn, empty cloud dreams and evolving shadows, a stillness like Jan Weenix’s gorgeous trophy pieces, dead birds with bloodstained feathers hanging from a foot, and in whatever wink of consciousness that remained to me I felt I understood the secret grandeur of dying, all the knowledge held back from all humankind until the very end: no pain, no fear, magnificent detachment, lying in state upon the death barge and receding into the grand immensities like an emperor, gone, gone, observing all the distant scurryers on shore, freed from all the old human pettiness of love and fear and grief and death.

Despite appearances, one can easily argue that technological progress has slowed since the last quarter of the twentieth century (the 1973 oil crisis to be specific). The low-hanging fruits (e.g., the speed of transcontinental flight, increase in age expectancy, median income in affluent societies, crop yields, truly significant new medicines) have been gathered up, and in many cases their rate of progress has either slowed or even reversed.

The continuity of history, if not its progress, is that last thread that secular, scientific man, unmoored in the universe on this floating rock, the play of titanic and foreign forces…it’s the last connection that he had to any sanity. I want a world of psychosis, I want the end of his sanity. What if there is no firm ground to what we receive from history, and the continuity we think we have is actually a jumbled and confused mess—that events from antiquity have been confused with events from the Middle Ages, for example? I found the suggestion of Fomenko, that the Crusades and the Trojan War were really the same event, to be so disorienting that I had to act out in a very vehement and stern way that day later.

Rosler warns, however, that the meaning of seriousness “swivels.” It used to be that certain subject matters (like women’s issues) weren’t considered significant enough to inspire artwork, but nowadays heftier themes may be perceived as too grave for art. “Today, art is supposed to be ambiguous or playful,” she says, so when a work deals with something like war or homelessness, “it can step outside the bounds of what is considered art.” Whatever the case, being serious should not be confused with humorlessness. Rosler often deploys humor to “bypass people’s defences when they see criticality coming at them.”

I liked to catch the metro a little after seven to give myself the illusion that I was one of the ‘early risers’ of France, the workers and tradesmen. I was the only one who enjoyed this fantasy, clearly, because when I gave my lecture, at eight, the hall was almost completely empty except for a small knot of chillingly serious Chinese women who rarely spoke to one another, let alone anyone else. The moment they walked in, they turned on their smartphones so they could record my entire lecture. This didn’t stop them from taking notes in their large spiral notebooks. They never interrupted, they never asked any questions, and the two hours were over before I knew it.

But how does a computer know if other computers want to send data at the same time? Engineers designed an ingenious method to solve this problem called "Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection", or CSMA/CD. It is a long name for a simple and elegant concept. When your computer wants to send data, it first listens to see if another computer is already sending data on the network (Carrier Sense). If no other computer is sending data, your computer starts sending its data. As your computer is sending data it also listens to see if it can receive its own data. If your computer receives its own data, it knows that the channel is still clear and continues transmitting. But if two computers started sending at about the same time, the data collides, and your computer does not receive its own data. When a collision is detected, both computers stop transmitting, wait a bit, and retry the transmission. The two computers that collided wait different lengths of time to retry their transmissions to reduce the chances of a second collision.

Sometimes it has seemed to me that life is a series of punishments for such moments of unawareness, that one forges one’s own destiny by what one doesn’t notice or feel compassion for; that what you don’t know and don’t make the effort to understand will become the very thing you are forced into knowledge of.

That day in London, Paniotis resumed, turning back to face me, I realised that my little dream of a publishing house was destined to remain just that, a fantasy, and in fact what that realisation caused me to feel was not so much disappointment at the situation as astonishment at the fantasy itself. It seemed incredible to me that at the age of fifty-one I was still capable of producing, in all innocence, a completely unrealisable hope.

But at a particular moment he was unable to provide the advance payments to these authors, many of whose books he had translated himself to cut costs. In London he found himself excoriated, even by the writers themselves, for non-payment of money that the books, strictly speaking, had not yet actually earned; he was treated with the greatest disdain by everyone, was threatened with legal action, and worst of all came away with the impression that these writers he had worshipped as the artists of our time were in fact cold and unempathetic people devoted to self-promotion and above all else, to money.

I understood, completely and definitively, that Chrysta and I were no longer married, and that the war we were embroiled in was not merely a bitterer version of the same lifelong engagement, but was something far more evil, something that had destruction, annihilation, non-existence as its ambition. Most of all it wanted silence: and this, I realised, was what my conversations with Chrysta were all leading towards, a silence that would in the end remain unbroken, though on this occasion she did break it.

That is always a dangerous moment, he said, to make a big decision, when you are not sure of what you deserve. Evidently his friends shared his opinion, because all of them urged him, without hesitation, to take it. It is interesting how keen people are for you to do something they would never dream of doing themselves, how enthusiastically they drive you to your own destruction: even the kindest ones, the ones that are most loving, can rarely have your interests truly at heart, because usually they are advising you from within lives of greater security and greater confinement, where escape is not a reality but simply something they dream of sometimes.

I said that, on the contrary, I had come to believe more and more in the virtues of passivity, and of living a life as unmarked by self-will as possible. One could make almost anything happen, if one tried hard enough, but the trying – it seemed to me – was almost always a sign that one was crossing the currents, was forcing events in a direction they did not naturally want to go, and though you might argue that nothing could ever be accomplished without going against nature to some extent, the artificiality of that vision and its consequences had become – to put it bluntly – anathema to me.

IAE conveys the sense of political tragedy: Everything is straining as hard as it can to be radical in a context where agency is perennially fucked, forever, for everyone. Art must, by lexical design, “interrogate” and “problematize” and “blur boundaries” and even “highlight blurred boundaries.” But the grammatical structures make failure a foregone conclusion.

Lady Gertrude had not thought of changing her dress. Nor had it occurred to her to prepare for the gathering.        She was seated in her bedroom. Her feet were planted widely apart as though for all time. Her elbows weighed on her knees, from between which the draperies of her skirt sagged in heavy U-shaped folds. In her hands was a paper-covered book, with a coffee-stain across its cover and with as many dogs' ears as it had pages. She was reading aloud in a deep voice that rose above the steady drone of a hundred cats. They filled the room. Whiter than the tallow that hung from the candelabra or lay broken on the table of birdseed. Whiter than the pillows on the bed. They sat everywhere. The counterpane was hidden with them. The table, the cupboards, the couch, all was luxuriant with harvest, white as death, but the richest crop was all about her feet where a cluster of white faces stared up into her own. Every luminous, slit-pupilled eye was upon her. The only movement lay in the vibration in their throats. The voice of the Countess moved on like a laden ship upon a purring tide.

The artistic photographer is a dilettante artist who apes an artistic manner minus its substance, instead of capturing the very lack of substance. Similarly, rhythmic gymnastics wants to incorporate the soul about which it knows nothing. It shares with artistic photography the ambition to lay claim to a higher lif in order to elevate an activity which is actually at its most elevated when it fnds the object appropriate to its technology. The artistic photographers function like thoe social frces which are interested in the semblance of the spiritual because they fear the real spirit: it might explode the material base which the spiritual illusion serves to disguise. I t would be well worth the effort to expose the close ties between the prevailing social order and artistic photography

Even in the classroom, the dominant definition of the legitimate way of appropriating culture and works of art favours those who have had early access to legitimate culture, in a cultured household, outside of scholastic disciplines, since even within the educational system it devalues scholarly knowledge and interpretation as ‘scholastic’ or even ‘pedantic’ in favour of direct experience and simple delight.

The ‘eye’ is a product of history reproduced by education. This is true of the mode of artistic perception now accepted as legitimate, that is, the aesthetic disposition, the capacity to consider in and for themselves, as form rather than function, not only the works designated for such apprehension, i.e., legitimate works of art, but everything in the world, including cultural objects which are not yet consecrated—such as, at one time, primitive arts, or, nowadays, popular photography or kitsch—and natural objects.

This mastery is, for the most part, acquired simply by contact with works of art—that is, through an implicit learning analogous to that which makes it possible to recognize familiar faces without explicit rules or criteria—and it generally remains at a practical level; it is what makes it possible to identify styles, i.e., modes of expression characteristic of a period, a civilization or a school, without having to distinguish clearly, or state explicitly, the features which constitute their originality.

This is seen clearly in the case of the novel and especially the theatre, where the working-class audience refuses any sort of formal experimentation and all the effects which, by introducing a distance from the accepted conventions (as regards scenery, plot etc.), tend to distance the spectator, preventing him from getting involved and fully identifying with the characters (I am thinking of Brechtian ‘alienation’ or the disruption of plot in the nouveau roman).

It would take Adam twenty years to grasp the analogy between her slipping from the chair and from the boat. He asked her some questions about her dad and she answered them. He considered telling her about entering the wrong house—maybe he could bring out the poetry of it—but he did not tell her, didn’t want to risk it. To protect himself (from what, he wasn’t sure), he imagined that he was looking back on the present from a vaguely imagined East Coast city where his experiences in Topeka could be recounted only with great irony.

He looked around intently, without, however, catching sight of them; instead, quite unexpectedly, another female reveller took him by the arm: it was his wife. She had just withdrawn rather abruptly from a stranger, whose blasé, melancholy air and foreign-sounding – evidently Polish – accent had at first intrigued her, but who had then suddenly let slip a surprisingly crude and insolent remark that had hurt and even frightened her. And so man and wife, glad at heart to have escaped a disappointingly banal charade, were soon sitting in the refreshment room over oysters and champagne, like two lovers among other amorous couples, and chatting amiably drew one another, as if they had just become acquainted, into a game of gallantry, seduction, resistance and fulfilment; and then, after a swift coach-ride through the white winter’s night, they sank into one another’s arms with an ardour they had not experienced for quite some time.

Finally, it should be noted that relative imports only work for modules that are located inside a proper package. In particular, they do not work inside simple modules located at the top level of scripts. They also won’t work if parts of a package are executed directly as a script. For example: % python3 mypackage/A/spam.py      # Relative imports fail On the other hand, if you execute the preceding script using the -m option to Python, the relative imports will work properly.

For this latter case, it’s most common to think of mymodule as being one large source file. However, this recipe shows how to stitch multiple files together into a single logical namespace.

It was pointed out to her, in the first place, that by leaving her with works of art her father had acted first and foremost with a view to relieving her of the burdens and responsibilities which the management of a block of flats, an agricultural estate, or a portfolio of African shares would have put upon her, and moreover, in the second place, that it would be difficult if not impossible to demonstrate that the division had been inequitable, since four canvases by a painter at the height of his fame were worth at least as much as a parcel of shares in a mine that had not even begun to produce and maybe never would.

The OPEC oil price hike that came with the oil embargo of 1973, placed vast amounts of financial power at the disposal of the oil producing states such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Abu Dhabi. We now know from British intelligence reports that the US was actively preparing to invade these countries in 1973 in order to restore the flow of oil and bring down oil prices. We also know that the Saudis agreed at that time, presumably under military pressure if not open threat from the US, to recycle all of their petrodollars through the New York investment banks.

For some it is a pretext for recriminations and enviousness, displays of jealousy and scorn; for others, it belongs to folklore and is of no real consequence. But for both groups of people, and for both the upstairs and the downstairs dwellers, it functions ultimately as a basic fact of life: the Louvets, for instance, say that the Plassaerts have “converted the maids’ rooms, but made their flat quite nice all the same”; the Plassaerts for their part feel obliged to stress that their three little attic rooms are “really cute” and to add that they got them for a song and to insinuate that they don’t lower their backsides onto reproduction Louis XV antiques like that old Moreau woman (which is, as it happens, entirely false).

This man, who seems past caring about anything, was, she says, the most popular clown in Warsaw before the war, and it is he who is portrayed on the poster on her wall. She met him three years ago in Anna de Noailles Square, where she was watching her son play in the sand pit. He sat down on the same bench, and she noticed he was reading a Polish edition of Gérard de Nerval’s Les Filles du feu – Sylwia i inne opowiadania. They became friends. He comes for dinner twice a month at her flat. As he has not a single tooth left, she feeds him on hot milk and custard.

These privileged instants were as rare as they were intoxicating, as fleeting as they were seemingly effective. Bartlebooth would soon revert to being a sandbag, a lifeless lump chained to his worktable, a blank-eyed subnormal, unable to see, waiting hours without knowing what he was waiting for. He did not feel hunger or thirst, or heat or cold; he could stay awake for more than forty hours doing nothing apart from taking the remaining unassembled pieces one by one, staring at them, turning them around, and putting them back without even trying to fit them, as if any try whatsoever was destined to fail inexorably. One time he stayed up for 62 hours at a stretch – from eight a.m. on the Wednesday until ten p.m. on the Friday – in front of an uncompleted puzzle depicting the seashore at Elsinore: a grey fringe between a grey sea and a grey sky.

all barriers to that free movement (such as planning controls) have to be removed except in those areas crucial to “the national interest” (however that may be conveniently defined). The watchword of the neo-liberal state is, therefore, “flexibility” (in labor markets and in the deployment of investment capital). It trumpets the virtues of competition while actually opening the market to centralized capital and monopoly power.

In the neo-liberal view, mass democracy is equated with “mob rule” and this typically produces all of the barriers to capital accumulation that so threatened the power of the upper classes in the 1970s. The preferred form of governance is that of the “public-private partnership” in which state and key business interests collaborate closely together to coordinate their activities around the aim of enhancing capital accumulation. The result is that the regulated get to write the rules of regulation while “public” decision-making becomes ever more opaque.

More than two thirds of the foreign direct investment that came in during the early 1990s (and an even greater percentage that survived) was organized by the overseas Chinese (particularly operating out of Hong Kong but also from Taiwan).

Informal land and property markets had arisen particularly in peripheral urban areas. This was accompanied by powerful waves of primitive accumulation. Commune leaders, for example, frequently assumed de facto property rights to communal land and assets in negotiations with foreign investors and these rights were later confirmed as belonging to them as individuals, in effect enclosing the commons to the benefit of the few and to the detriment of the mass of the population.

Aggregate growth rates stood at 3.5 percent or so in the 1960s and even during the troubled 1970s fell only to 2.4 percent. But the subsequent global growth rates of 1.4 percent and 1.1 percent for the 1980s and 1990s (and a rate that barely touches 1 percent since 2000) indicate that neo-liberalism has broadly failed to stimulate world-wide growth.40 Why, then, are so many persuaded that neo-liberalism is the “only alternative” and that it has been so successful?

The intellectual property rights established through the so-called TRIPS agreement within the WTO defines genetic materials, seed plasmas, and all manner of other products, as private property. Rents for use can then be extracted from populations whose practices had played a crucial role in the development of these genetic materials. Biopiracy is rampant and the pillaging of the world’s stockpile of genetic resources is well under way to the benefit of a few large pharmaceutical companies.

Defenders of this regime of rights plausibly argue that it encourages “bourgeois virtues,” without which everyone in the world would be far worse off. These include individual responsibility and liability, independence from state interference (which often places this regime of rights in severe opposition to those defined within the state), equality of opportunity in the market and before the law, rewards for initiative and entrepreneurial endeavors, care for oneself and one’s own, and an open market place that allows for wide-ranging freedoms of choice of both contract and exchange.

This system of rights appears even more persuasive when extended to the right of private property in one’s own body (which underpins the right of the person to freely contract to sell his or her labor power as well as to be treated with dignity and respect and to be free from bodily coercions such as slavery) and the right to freedom of thought, of expression and of speech.

In this text, he set out the main categories and principles of the doctrine of literary realism that he was to maintain for the rest of his life: the reiterated antithesis between naturalism and realism, the notion of the typical character as a nexus of the social and individual, the rejection of both external reportage and internal psychologism, the distinction between passive description and active narrative, the extolment of Balzac and Tolstoy as classical models for the contemporary novel.

Works of art can fail so easily; it is so difficult for them to succeed. One man will fall silent because of lack of feeling; another, because his emotion chokes him. A third frees himself, not from the burden that weighs on him, but only from a feeling of unfreedom. A fourth breaks his tools because they have too long been used to exploit him. The world is not obliged to be sentimental. Defeats should be acknowledged; but one should not conclude from them that there should be no more struggles.

It is the power which arises from ‘shaping perceptions, cognitions and preferences in such a way that they [i.e. social agents] accept their role in the existing order of things, either because they can see or imagine no alternative to it, or because they see it as natural and unchangeable, or because they value it as divinely ordained or beneficial’ (Lukes, 1975, p.24). This is an ‘ideological’ model of power, by whatever other name it is called. The move from the pluralist to the critical model of media research centrally involved a shift from a one-to the two-and threedimensional models of power in modern societies

Changing the terms of an argument is exceedingly difficult, since the dominant definition of the problem acquires, by repetition, and by the weight and credibility of those who propose or subscribe it, the warrant of ‘common sense’. Arguments which hold to this definition of the problem are accounted as following ‘logically’. Arguments which seek to change the terms of reference are read as ‘straying from the point’

Literature appears by no means only in the emergent sector, which is always, in fact, quite rare. A great deal of writing is of a residual kind, and this has been deeply true of much English literature in the last half- century. Some of its fundamental meanings and values have belonged to the cultural achievements of long-past stages of society. So widespread is this fact, and the habits of mind it supports, that in many minds ‘literature’ and ’the past’ acquire a certain identity, and it is then said that there is now no literature: all that glory is over.

It is in this sense that radio and television, in all forms other than the simplest direct transmission, and then video and film, have to be seen finally as alternative modes, rather than as simply amplificatory or durative. Even in direct transmission in television, so apparently technical a matter as the positioning of the camera is a crucial signifying element. In a confrontation between police and demonstrators it matters absolutely, for example, whether the camera is placed (as so regularly) behind the police, or, as in a different social perspective it can be, behind the demonstrators, or again, which can sometimes happen, in impartial relations to both.

Of critical importance, in this respect, and as the necessary ground for any effective transition, is sustained discussion and demonstration of the inherent transforming processes involved in, for example, television and film. The modes of ‘naturalization’ of these means of communicative production need to be repeatedly analyzed and emphasized, for they are indeed so powerful, and new generations are becoming so habituated to them that here as strongly as anywhere, in the modern socio-economic process, the real activities and relations of men are hidden behind a reified form, a reified mode, a ‘modern medium’.

Illusion—the ordinary ideological experience of men—is the material on which the writer goes to work; but in working on it he transforms it into something different, lends it a shape and structure.

The work which is sold on the market to anonymous thousands will characteristically differ in form from the work produced under a patronage system, just as the drama written for a popular theatre will tend to differ in formal conventions from that produced for private theatre.

They floated and trod water and ended up on that island along with the horses that had swum ashore. Some of them were only partially blinded and were rescued later by the French, and returned to Queen of France and indenture. The others, totally blind, hid. The ones who came back had children who, as they got on into middle age, went blind too. What they saw, they saw with the eye of the mind, and that, of course, was not to be trusted.

The query_posts() function is used to easily modify the content returned for the default WordPress Loop. Specifically, you can modify the content returned in $wp_query after the default database query has executed, fine-tune the query parameters, and re-execute the query using query_posts(). The downside to calling query_posts() in this fashion is that the previously cached results from the default query are discarded, so you’re incurring a database performance hit to use this shortcut.

Economists have a tendency to adopt a notion of well-being that is often too narrow, some version of income or material consumption. And yet all of us need much more than that to have a fulfilling life: the respect of the community, the comforts of family and friends, dignity, lightness, pleasure. The focus on income alone is not just a convenient shortcut. It is a distorting lens that often has led the smartest economists down the wrong path, policy makers to the wrong decisions, and all too many of us to the wrong obsessions. It is what persuades so many of us that the whole world is waiting at the door to take our well-paying jobs. It is what has led to a single-minded focus on restoring the Western nations to some glorious past of fast economic growth. It is what makes us simultaneously deeply suspicious of those who don’t have money and terrified to find ourselves in their shoes. It is also what makes the trade-off between the growth of the economy and the survival of the planet seem so stark.

A report by the Center for American Entrepreneurship found that, in 2017, out of the largest five hundred US companies by revenue (the Fortune 500 list), 43 percent were founded or co-founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants. Moreover, immigrant-founded firms account for 52 percent of the top twenty-five firms, 57 percent of the top thirty-five firms, and nine of the top thirteen most valuable brands.36 Henry Ford was the son of an Irish immigrant. Steve Jobs’s biological father was from Syria, Sergey Brin was born in Russia. Jeff Bezos takes his name from his stepfather, the Cuban immigrant Mike Bezos.

In fact, there is a long tradition in economics, going back at least to Frank Knight, of distinguishing between quantifiable risk (50 percent probability this happens, 50 percent that happens) and the rest, what Donald Rumsfeld memorably called the “unknown unknowns,”65 and Knightian economists call uncertainty.66

We would therefore expect a labor-rich country to specialize in labor-intensive products and move out of capital-intensive ones. This should raise the demand for labor compared to when there was no trade (or more restricted trade), and therefore wages. And, conversely, in a relatively capital-abundant country, we should expect instead that the price of capital goes up (and wages go down) when it trades with a more labor-abundant partner.

That does not mean the workers in the United States must necessarily end up worse off. This is because, as Samuelson showed in a later paper, the fact that free trade raises GNP means there is more to go around for everybody, and therefore even workers in the United States can be made better off if society taxes the winners from free trade and distributes that money to the losers.9 The problem is that this is a big “if,” which leaves workers at the mercy of the political process.

1.   Ecological challenges, such as warding off predators, hunting big game, domesticating fire, finding new food sources, and adapting rapidly to new climates. These activities pit humans against their environment and are therefore opportunities for cooperation. 2.   Social challenges, such as competition for mates, jockeying for social status, coalition politics (alliances, betrayals, etc.), intra-group violence, cheating, and deception. These activities pit humans against other humans and are therefore competitive and potentially destructive.

This is illustrated rather dramatically by the rare but well-documented condition known as blindsight, which typically follows from some kind of brain damage, like a stroke to the visual cortex. Just like people who are conventionally blind, blindsighted patients swear they can’t see. But when presented with flashcards and forced to guess what’s on the card, they do better than chance. Clearly some parts of their brains are registering visual information, even if the parts responsible for conscious awareness are kept in the dark.

When part of the brain has to process a sensitive piece of information—wanting to get the upper hand in a particular interaction, for example—it doesn’t necessarily make a big conscious fuss about it. Instead, we might just feel vaguely uneasy until we’ve gained the upper hand, whereupon we’ll feel comfortable ending the conversation. At no point does the motive “Get the upper hand” rise to full conscious attention, but the same result is accomplished discreetly. Information is sensitive in part because it can threaten our self-image and therefore our social image. So the rest of the brain conspires—whispers—to keep such information from becoming too prominent, especially in consciousness.

If speakers deliver high-quality information, why should listeners care whether the information is related to the current topic? A plausible answer is that it’s simply too easy to rattle off memorized trivia. You can recite random facts from the encyclopedia until you’re blue in the face, but that does little to advertise your generic facility with information. Similarly, when you meet someone for the first time, you’re more eager to sniff each other out for this generic skill, rather than to exchange the most important information each of you has gathered to this point in your lives.

Heidegger, in other words, was not quite conscious of the astonishing implications of the discovery he made in the tool-analysis: that when equipment—which for all intents and purposes could be anything at all—is functioning, or “executing” (Vollzug), it withdraws from access (Entzug); that it is only when a tool is broken that it seems to become present-at-hand (vorhanden). This can only mean, argues Harman, that there is a vast plenum of unique entities, one of whose essential properties is withdrawal—no other entity can fully account for them. These entities must exist in a relatively flat ontology in which there is hardly any difference between a person and a pincushion. And relationships between them, including causal ones, must be vicarious and hence aesthetic in nature.

Any other woman but Emilia would perhaps not have put up with this provisional arrangement; but, in the case of Emilia, I think that, by accepting it, she gave me the greatest proof of love that a devoted wife can give to a husband. Emilia was, indeed, what is called a born housewife; but in her love of home there was more than the natural inclination common to all women; I mean that there was something that resembled a deep, jealous passion, almost a hunger, which went beyond her own self and seemed to derive its origin from some ancestral situation.

Imagine you are a machine. Yes, I know. But imagine you're a different kind of machine, one built from metal and plastic and designed not by blind, haphazard natural selection but by engineers and astrophysicists with their eyes fixed firmly on specific goals. Imagine that your purpose is not to replicate, or even to survive, but to gather information. I can imagine that easily. It is in fact a much simpler impersonation than the kind I'm usually called on to perform. I coast through the abyss on the colder side of Neptune's orbit. Most of the time I exist only as an absence, to any observer on the visible spectrum: a moving, asymmetrical silhouette blocking the stars.

For example, the wage gap between the traditionally disadvantaged castes (SC/STs) and others dropped from 35 percent in 1983 to 29 percent in 2004.14 This does not look so spectacular, but is more than the improvement in the wage gap between blacks and whites in the United States over a similar time period. In part this is the result of the affirmative action policies Ambedkar put into place, which gave historically discriminated groups privileged access to educational institutions, government jobs, and the various legislatures.

The most surprising finding, however, was that the BTB policy substantially increased racial disparities in callbacks. White applicants to BTB-affected employers received 7 percent more callbacks than similar black applicants before BTB. After BTB, this gap grew to 43 percent. The reason was that without the actual information about convictions, the employers assumed all black applicants were more likely to have a conviction. In other words, the BTB policy led employers to rely on race to predict criminality, which is of course statistical discrimination.

The business community, which is sometimes smart enough not to buy into the ideological messaging it offers the rest of us, has been for some years focused on another way out for the abundant capital in its hands. We noticed this about twenty years ago, when, all of a sudden, businesspeople, perhaps sensing they could not count on reliable economic growth in the West, started to quiz us about the countries we knew best, which are all in the developing world. We had become inured to the slightly uncomfortable expression that appeared on the faces of most businesspeople as soon they found out what we do, which is study poor countries—they clearly wanted to find someone else who knew something more useful to them, and were trying to figure out how quickly they could dump us without causing offence. But, suddenly, a couple of decades ago, poor countries became interesting.

It is in this sense that we live in “gamespace,”9 where digital video games are more than just an emergent form of cultural narrative. Instead, specific forms of games—especially those that feature self-interested players in war or business—in many cases embody ideal variations of what came to be realized in more random, sometimes catastrophic, ways. This may also explain why so many video games are located at the intersection of military action and economic profit, and why they model destruction as opportunity. If we think of them not only as Platonic ideals but as training grounds and behavioral schools—as “serious games,” in Harun Farocki’s formulation—it’s easy to see that generations of players were rewarded if they behaved in ways that were considered rationally self-interested.

The virus had been self-aware, somewhat smarter than a human being. It had been a melancholy creature, knowing itself to be doomed to a brief microsecond of existence, and puzzled about the outside world it had deduced must exist somewhere. But these philosophical ruminations had not made it hesitate in its duties. It had not paid much attention to Phaethon's security programs, any more than a man engaged in a life-or-death struggle was aware of a mosquito. For the virus entity had been at war. (It Was more apt to call it the "virus civilization"—during the last part of the third nanosecond, the scattering and fragmentary records showed that the entity had reproduced into thousands, developed a strange sort of art and literature and other-interactions for which Phaethon had no names, trying to come to terms with a brief, vicious existence.) The virus civilization had fought several engagements with the security surrounding the Eleemosynary Hospice public-casket interface.

She was a dynamite girl and he was an aces fellow. On the day he at last agreed by phone to marry her, the switchboard operators were overjoyed. For six months they had listened, in sympathy and indignation, to the tears, the threats, the partings and reconciliations. They were so unequivocally for the girl that only the purest professionalism kept them, at times, from breaking in. On the day Tim, after calls to his best friend, his first wife, and his therapist, gave in at last, the oldest operator, who had been on the switchboard for twenty years, actually wept. The other two told the receptionist, at lunch. All four ladies had a drink, and then bought a card of slightly obscene felicitations. They had wavered toward the sentimental, but rejected it as basically unswinging. They did not sign the card. Tim and his girl, who had been breaking up once again on the day they received it (she was packing; they were in his apartment), were appalled. As a result of the card, and discussions of what to do about it—what it implied, who knew and who didn’t—they married.

What is the point. That is what must be borne in mind. Sometimes the point is really who wants what. Sometimes the point is what is right or kind. Sometimes the point is a momentum, a fact, a quality, a voice, an intimation, a thing said or unsaid. Sometimes it’s who’s at fault, or what will happen if you do not move at once. The point changes and goes out. You cannot be forever watching for the point, or you lose the simplest thing: being a major character in your own life. But if you are, for any length of time, custodian of the point—in art, in court, in politics, in lives, in rooms—it turns out there are rear-guard actions everywhere. To see a thing clearly, and when your vision of it dims, or when it goes to someone else, if you have a gentle nature, keep your silence, that is lovely. Otherwise, now and then, a small foray is worthwhile. Just so that being always, complacently, thoroughly wrong does not become the safest position of them all. The point has never quite been entrusted to me.

Summer. The speedboat was serious. The young tycoon was serious about it, as he was serious about his factories, his wife, his children, his parties, his work, his art collection, his resort. The little group had just had lunch, at sea, aboard the tycoon’s larger boat, a schooner.

Some people, in a frenzy of antipathy and boredom, were drinking themselves into extreme approximations of longing to be together. Exchanging phone numbers, demanding to have lunch, proposing to share an apartment—the escalations of fellowship had the air of a terminal auction, a fierce adult version of slapjack, a bill-payer loan from a finance company, an attempt to buy with one grand convivial debt, to be paid in future, an exit from each other’s company at that instant.

But from the years of the clay ashtrays, through the year in the war when his nine-year-old son somehow bought him an object, at the fair, called a butter stretcher, to the years of things in gold, scrapbooks, and family poems, he was, for his own reasons but like almost everyone else, as saddened by Christmas as though the world had died.

It is not at all uncommon for someone to arrive at a scene of brutality or injustice and, with a sympathetic murmur or heroic flourish, attack the victim. It happens all the time. It underlies the columns, for example, of Dr. Franzblau. But the particular consequence of his moral vanity was that when he did people an injury, he never forgave them. Never again.

We spoke of the quality of the blue in the stained-glass windows of Chartres, which modern science had not been able to reproduce, as though the medieval craftsman who had produced it were a colleague. He had, we knew, billed his diocese for the purchase of sapphires ground up to create that color. Modern science had, at least, established that sapphires played no part in its composition at all. It was our first, most scholarly appreciation of the padded expense account.

The idea of hostages is very deep. Becoming pregnant is taking a hostage—as is running a pawnshop, being a bank, receiving a letter, taking a photograph, or listening to a confidence. Every love story, every commercial trade, every secret, every matter in which trust is involved, is a gentle transaction of hostages.

It all began in Miletus, a once-thriving Aegean port whose ruins (now landlocked due to the silting effect of rivers) can still be visited near present-day Didim, Turkey. Thales of Miletus is known for a number of mental exploits, such as being the first to predict an eclipse of the sun. But his main legacy for philosophy and science can be found in his claim that water is the first principle of everything. This is thought to be the first instance in Western civilization in which the cosmos was explained by appealing to something natural, rather than to the gods or some creation myth. There followed another resident of the city named Anaximenes who held that air rather than water was the primordial element: for air is even more neutral in its features than water, being tasteless, odourless, and transparent to light. But in between Thales and Anaximenes came Anaximander, who adopted a more sophisticated-sounding position by claiming that the primordial root of everything cannot be an element, since all the different physical elements must emerge jointly from some deeper root. For Anaximander, this deeper root was the apeiron: a word usually left untranslated in English, but which means something like a shapeless, formless, limitless mass from which everything more specific emerges. As Anaximander saw it, over the course of millions of years all opposites would mutually cancel each other out, and the cosmos would be restored to the formless, neutral apeiron, an idea that later inspired Karl Marx as he wrote his doctoral thesis at Jena. Numerous other pre-Socratic thinkers offered their own theories about reality: Pythagoras, Empedocles, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Anaxagoras, Democritus, and more.

That is true, up to a point’, he said, luxuriating in his selfdespair, ‘but can’t you imagine someone having ambitions which he himself realizes to be only shadows, like a charcoal sketch on a canvas for a picture which the artist knows he will never paint and that will always remain a sketch? The ambition itself is only charcoal, it will never take on living colours. Yet the artist is good enough for the charcoal sketch always to remain there, for him to look at and torment himself with as the unrealized, unrealizable possibility.

There would be some kind of mutuality of shown affection in being with him until he had come. This took, it is true, an infinity of rock-like minutes while Ernst struggled towards his arid climax. Paul, lying by his side and being crawled over by Ernst, could not have felt more separate from him had he been in Hamburg and Ernst in Altamunde. Indeed he felt an aloneness which was beyond them both, beyond himself even, as though he had no existence except this being alone.

Early on, in 1941, came Edmund Wilson's book The Wound and the Bow, which reinvoked the ancient Greek formula of the mad genius. After discussing the psychological harm suffered in childhood by Dickens, Kipling, and others, Wilson concluded that "genius and disease, like strength and mutilation, may be inextricably bound up together." In 1945, Wilson made the point again, by publishing, under the title The Crack-Up, a collection of the later writings of his friend F. Scott Fitzgerald.

It is said that people learn from experience, and in general this is true. Experience is the best and, perhaps, the only real teacher. But when something falls within the area of a person's neurosis, the rule does not seem to apply. The person doesn't learn from experience but repeats the same self-destructive behavior again and again.

He would be listened to in solemn silence, sit down amidst a murmur of approval, and the instructor, winding up the proceedings, would point out that of all the speakers Comrade X had formulated the problem in the happiest and most concrete terms.

I decided to make him my fid. People would think I was doing it to be charitable. Maybe some would even think I was getting ready to fall back, and was making the care of Barb my avocation. Let them think so! In truth it was mostly self-interest. I had learned more theorics in six weeks, simply by being willing to sit next to Barb, than I had in six months before Apert. I saw now that in my desire to know theorics I had taken shortcuts that, just like shortcuts on a map, turned out to be longcuts. Whenever I’d seen Jesry get it quicker than me, I had misread equations in a way that had seemed easier at the time but made things harder—no, impossible—later.

faster; because of how his brain was set up, he couldn’t read that in their faces. And he did not have the same desire to reach a distant goal. He was altogether self-centered and short-sighted. He wanted only to understand this one problem or equation chalked on the slate before him now, today, whether or not it was convenient for the others around him. And he was willing to stand there asking questions about it through supper and past curfew. Come to think of it, Ala and Tulia had come up with a similar way of learning a long time ago. The creature with two backs was a term Jesry had coined for those two girls when they stood together outside of a chalk hall discussing—endlessly—what they had just heard. It wasn’t enough for one of them to understand something. Nor for both of them to understand it in different ways. They both had to understand it in the same way. The sound of them furiously explaining things to each other gave the rest of us headaches. Especially when we’d been younger, we’d always clap our hands over our ears and run away when we spotted the creature with two backs. But it worked for them. Barb’s willingness to do things the hard way in the near term was making his advancement toward the long goal—even though he didn’t have one—swifter and surer than mine had ever been. And now I was advancing in step with him.

As he was winding down discussion of the work as a cheap imitation of Martha Rosler by someone who had never heard of her—maybe this was what it was, actually, the combination of feminist art knowledge with unapologetic contempt for ahistorical hacks—I began to nod a little more purposefully than I had with the señoritas and asked, flatteringly, in a low, teasing voice, “Are you an artist?”

Climate change is a problem of carbon stocks, not carbon flows: the earth system is like a bathtub, filling up (an analogy used by climate modeler John Sterman and educator Linda Booth Sweeney). Reducing the flow of water into the bathtub isn’t going to fix our problem unless we’re actually draining it, too: the amount of emissions can be reduced, but greenhouse gas concentrations will still be rising.

as anthropologist David Graeber observes, technological progress since the 1970s has been largely in information technologies, technologies of simulation. Graeber notes that there was a shift from “investment in technologies associated with the possibility of alternative futures to investment in technologies that furthered labor discipline and social control”11—in other words, it’s a big mistake to assume capitalism is naturally technologically progressive.

Years later—fairly often, actually—when some little whore was sucking him off, Bruno would remember those few seconds of terrifying joy; he also remembered the moment when Caroline Yessayan moved his hand away. What the boy had felt was something pure, something gentle, something that predates sex or sensual fulfillment. It was the simple desire to reach out and touch a loving body, to be held in loving arms. Tenderness is a deeper instinct than seduction, which is why it is so difficult to give up hope.

Both of them knew that this would be their last human relationship, and this feeling lacerated every moment they spent together. They had a great respect and a profound sympathy for each other, and there were days when, caught up in some sudden magic, they knew moments of fresh air and glorious, bracing sunshine. For the most part, however, they could feel a gray shadow moving over them, on the earth that supported them, and in everything they could glimpse the end.

Though it may be indefinitely postponed, the idea of a more personal, human relationship never fades, quite simply because human relationships do not fit easily into narrow, fixed compartments. Human beings therefore think of relationships as potentially “deep and meaningful”—an idea that can persist for years, until a single brutal act (usually something like death) makes it plain that it’s too late, that the “deep, meaningful” relationship they had cherished will never exist, any more than any of the others had. In his fifteen years of professional experience, Desplechin was the one person with whom Michel would’ve liked to have a relationship beyond the utilitarian, infinitely irritating chance juxtapositions of office life. Well, now it was too late. Devastated, he glanced at the boxes of books piled on the floor of the office. “I think it might be better if we went for a drink somewhere,” Desplechin suggested, aptly summing up the mood of the moment.

But I can tell you, she comes out of the old Moscow Soviet culture, university and CP for both her mother and her grandmother. And men were the enemies for Maya’s babushka, and for her mother too, it was a matrioshka. Maya’s mother used to say to her, ‘Women are the roots, men are just the leaves.’ There was a whole culture of mistrust, manipulation, fear. That’s where Maya comes from. And at the same time we have this tradition of amicochonstvo, a kind of intense friendship where you learn the very tiniest details of your friend’s life, you invade each other’s lives in a sense, and of course that’s impossible and it has to end, usually badly.”

As explained by Thomas and Mary Edsall in their insightful book Chain Reaction, a disproportionate share of the costs of integration and racial equality had been borne by lower- and lower-middle-class whites, who were suddenly forced to compete on equal terms with blacks for jobs and status and who lived in neighborhoods adjoining black ghettos. Their children—not the children of wealthy whites—attended schools most likely to fall under busing orders.

Practically overnight the budgets of federal law enforcement agencies soared. Between 1980 and 1984, FBI antidrug funding increased from $8 million to $95 million.72 Department of Defense antidrug allocations increased from $33 million in 1981 to $1,042 million in 1991. During that same period, DEA antidrug spending grew from $86 to $1,026 million, and FBI antidrug allocations grew from $38 to $181 million.73 By contrast, funding for agencies responsible for drug treatment, prevention, and education was dramatically reduced. The budget of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, for example, was reduced from $274 million to $57 million from 1981 to 1984, and antidrug funds allocated to the Department of Education were cut from $14 million to $3 million.74

Upon doing so, the judge noted his reluctance to send the young man away for life for three marijuana sales. He said from the bench, “The Court believes that to sentence Mr. Angelos to prison for the rest of his life is unjust, cruel, and even irrational.”80 Some federal judges, including conservative judges, have quit in protest of federal drug laws and sentencing guidelines. Face-to-face with those whose lives hang in the balance, they are far closer to the human tragedy occasioned by the drug war than the legislators who write the laws from afar. Judge Lawrence Irving, a Reagan appointee, noted upon his retirement: “If I remain on the bench, I have no choice but to follow the law. I just can’t, in good conscience, continue to do this.”81 Other judges, such as Judge Jack Weinstein, publicly refused to take any more drug cases, describing “a sense of depression about much of the cruelty I have been a party to in connection with the ‘war on drugs.’”82 Another Reagan appointee, Judge Stanley Marshall, told a reporter, “I’ve always been considered a fairly harsh sentencer, but it’s killing me that I’m sending so many low-level offenders away for all this time.”

Nearly all of the cases alleging racial profiling in drug-law enforcement were brought pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its implementing regulations. Title VI prohibits federally funded programs or activities from discriminating on the basis of race, and the regulations employ a “disparate impact test” for discrimination—meaning that plaintiffs could prevail in claims of race discrimination without proving discriminatory intent.

The consequences for real families can be devastating. Without housing, people can lose their children. Take for example, the forty-two-year-old African American man who applied for public housing for himself and his three children who were living with him at the time.13 He was denied because of an earlier drug possession charge for which he had pleaded guilty and served thirty days in jail. Of course, the odds that he would have been convicted of drug possession would have been extremely low if he were white. But as an African American, he was not only targeted by the drug war but then denied access to housing because of his conviction. Since being denied housing, he has lost custody of his children and is homeless. Many nights he sleeps outside on the streets. Stiff punishment, indeed, for a minor drug offense—especially for his children, who are innocent of any crime.

African Americans are not significantly more likely to use or sell prohibited drugs than whites, but they are made criminals at drastically higher rates for precisely the same conduct. In fact, studies suggest that white professionals may be the most likely of any group to have engaged in illegal drug activity in their lifetime, yet they are the least likely to be made criminals.

A new civil rights movement cannot be organized around the relics of the earlier system of control if it is to address meaningfully the racial realities of our time. Any racial justice movement, to be successful, must vigorously challenge the public consensus that underlies the prevailing system of control. Nooses, racial slurs, and overt bigotry are widely condemned by people across the political spectrum; they are understood to be remnants of the past, no longer reflective of the prevailing public consensus about race. Challenging these forms of racism is certainly necessary, as we must always remain vigilant, but it will do little to shake the foundations of the current system of control. The new caste system, unlike its predecessors, is officially colorblind. We must deal with it on its own terms.

Queueing delays often account for a large part of the response time at high percentiles. As a server can only process a small number of things in parallel (limited, for example, by its number of CPU cores), it only takes a small number of slow requests to hold up the processing of subsequent requests—an effect sometimes known as head-of-line blocking. Even if those subsequent requests are fast to process on the server, the client will see a slow overall response time due to the time waiting for the prior request to complete. Due to this effect, it is important to measure response times on the client side.

When generating load artificially in order to test the scalability of a system, the load-generating client needs to keep sending requests independently of the response time. If the client waits for the previous request to complete before sending the next one, that behavior has the effect of artificially keeping the queues shorter in the test than they would be in reality, which skews the measurements

Even if only a small percentage of backend calls are slow, the chance of getting a slow call increases if an end-user request requires multiple backend calls, and so a higher proportion of end-user requests end up being slow (an effect known as tail latency amplification [24]).

The naïve implementation is to keep a list of response times for all requests within the time window and to sort that list every minute. If that is too inefficient for you, there are algorithms that can calculate a good approximation of percentiles at minimal CPU and memory cost, such as forward decay [25], t-digest [26], or HdrHistogram [27]. Beware that averaging percentiles, e.g., to reduce the time resolution or to combine data from several machines, is mathematically meaningless—the right way of aggregating response time data is to add the histograms

Example 2-2 suggested that graph data can be represented in a relational database. But if we put graph data in a relational structure, can we also query it using SQL? The answer is yes, but with some difficulty. In a relational database, you usually know in advance which joins you need in your query. In a graph query, you may need to traverse a variable number of edges before you find the vertex you’re looking for—that is, the number of joins is not fixed in advance.

Concurrency and crash recovery are much simpler if segment files are append-only or immutable.

In order to find a particular key in the file, you no longer need to keep an index of all the keys in memory. See Figure 3-5 for an example: say you’re looking for the key handiwork, but you don’t know the exact offset of that key in the segment file. However, you do know the offsets for the keys handbag and handsome, and because of the sorting you know that handiwork must appear between those two. This means you can jump to the offset for handbag and scan from there until you find handiwork (or not, if the key is not present in the file).

It only suffers from one problem: if the database crashes, the most recent writes (which are in the memtable but not yet written out to disk) are lost. In order to avoid that problem, we can keep a separate log on disk to which every write is immediately appended, just like in the previous section. That log is not in sorted order, but that doesn’t matter, because its only purpose is to restore the memtable after a crash. Every time the memtable is written out to an SSTable, the corresponding log can be discarded.

An additional complication of updating pages in place is that careful concurrency control is required if multiple threads are going to access the B-tree at the same time—otherwise a thread may see the tree in an inconsistent state. This is typically done by protecting the tree’s data structures with latches (lightweight locks). Log-structured approaches are simpler in this regard, because they do all the merging in the background without interfering with incoming queries and atomically swap old segments for new segments from time to time.

Log-structured indexes also rewrite data multiple times due to repeated compaction and merging of SSTables. This effect—one write to the database resulting in multiple writes to the disk over the course of the database’s lifetime—is known as write amplification. It is of particular concern on SSDs, which can only overwrite blocks a limited number of times before wearing out.

LSM-trees can be compressed better, and thus often produce smaller files on disk than B-trees. B-tree storage engines leave some disk space unused due to fragmentation: when a page is split or when a row cannot fit into an existing page, some space in a page remains unused. Since LSM-trees are not page-oriented and periodically rewrite SSTables to remove fragmentation, they have lower storage overheads,

Storing values within the index The key in an index is the thing that queries search for, but the value can be one of two things: it could be the actual row (document, vertex) in question, or it could be a reference to the row stored elsewhere. In the latter case, the place where rows are stored is known as a heap file, and it stores data in no particular order (it may be append-only, or it may keep track of deleted rows in order to overwrite them with new data later).

One option is to translate a two-dimensional location into a single number using a space-filling curve, and then to use a regular B-tree index [34]. More commonly, specialized spatial indexes such as R-trees are used. For example, PostGIS implements geospatial indexes as R-trees using PostgreSQL’s Generalized Search Tree indexing facility [35].

Counterintuitively, the performance advantage of in-memory databases is not due to the fact that they don’t need to read from disk. Even a disk-based storage engine may never need to read from disk if you have enough memory, because the operating system caches recently used disk blocks in memory anyway. Rather, they can be faster because they can avoid the overheads of encoding in-memory data structures in a form that can be written to disk

For example, there could be separate tables for brands and product categories, and each row in the dim_product table could reference the brand and category as foreign keys, rather than storing them as strings in the dim_product table.

Different queries benefit from different sort orders, so why not store the same data sorted in several different ways? Data needs to be replicated to multiple machines anyway, so that you don’t lose data if one machine fails. You might as well store that redundant data sorted in different ways so that when you’re processing a query, you can use the version that best fits the query pattern.

As you can see in Figure 4-4, the encoding of a repeated field is just what it says on the tin: the same field tag simply appears multiple times in the record. This has the nice effect that it’s okay to change an optional (single-valued) field into a repeated (multi-valued) field. New code reading old data sees a list with zero or one elements (depending on whether the field was present); old code reading new data sees only the last element of the list.

The actor model is a programming model for concurrency in a single process. Rather than dealing directly with threads (and the associated problems of race conditions, locking, and deadlock), logic is encapsulated in actors. Each actor typically represents one client or entity, it may have some local state (which is not shared with any other actor), and it communicates with other actors by sending and receiving asynchronous messages. Message delivery is not guaranteed: in certain error scenarios, messages will be lost. Since each actor processes only one message at a time, it doesn’t need to worry about threads, and each actor can be scheduled independently by the framework. In distributed actor frameworks, this programming model is used to scale an application across multiple nodes. The same message-passing mechanism is used, no matter whether the sender and recipient are on the same node or different nodes. If they are on different nodes, the message is transparently encoded into a byte sequence, sent over the network, and decoded on the other side.

For that reason, it is impractical for all followers to be synchronous: any one node outage would cause the whole system to grind to a halt. In practice, if you enable synchronous replication on a database, it usually means that one of the followers is synchronous, and the others are asynchronous. If the synchronous follower becomes unavailable or slow, one of the asynchronous followers is made synchronous. This guarantees that you have an up-to-date copy of the data on at least two nodes: the leader and one synchronous follower. This configuration is sometimes also called semi-synchronous

Fortunately, setting up a follower can usually be done without downtime. Conceptually, the process looks like this: Take a consistent snapshot of the leader’s database at some point in time—if possible, without taking a lock on the entire database. Most databases have this feature, as it is also required for backups. In some cases, third-party tools are needed, such as innobackupex for MySQL [12]. Copy the snapshot to the new follower node. The follower connects to the leader and requests all the data changes that have happened since the snapshot was taken. This requires that the snapshot is associated with an exact position in the leader’s replication log. That position has various names: for example, PostgreSQL calls it the log sequence number, and MySQL calls it the binlog coordinates.

In certain fault scenarios (see Chapter 8), it could happen that two nodes both believe that they are the leader. This situation is called split brain, and it is dangerous: if both leaders accept writes, and there is no process for resolving conflicts (see “Multi-Leader Replication”), data is likely to be lost or corrupted. As a safety catch, some systems have a mechanism to shut down one node if two leaders are detected.ii However, if this mechanism is not carefully designed, you can end up with both nodes being shut down

An alternative is to use different log formats for replication and for the storage engine, which allows the replication log to be decoupled from the storage engine internals. This kind of replication log is called a logical log, to distinguish it from the storage engine’s (physical) data representation.

In circular and star topologies, a write may need to pass through several nodes before it reaches all replicas. Therefore, nodes need to forward data changes they receive from other nodes. To prevent infinite replication loops, each node is given a unique identifier, and in the replication log, each write is tagged with the identifiers of all the nodes it has passed through [43]. When a node receives a data change that is tagged with its own identifier, that data change is ignored, because the node knows that it has already been processed.

The latter is known as a sloppy quorum [37]: writes and reads still require w and r successful responses, but those may include nodes that are not among the designated n “home” nodes for a value. By analogy, if you lock yourself out of your house, you may knock on the neighbor’s door and ask whether you may stay on their couch temporarily. Once the network interruption is fixed, any writes that one node temporarily accepted on behalf of another node are sent to the appropriate “home” nodes. This is called hinted handoff.

This approach to querying a partitioned database is sometimes known as scatter/gather, and it can make read queries on secondary indexes quite expensive. Even if you query the partitions in parallel, scatter/gather is prone to tail latency amplification (see “Percentiles in Practice”).

Fortunately, there is a fairly simple solution: create many more partitions than there are nodes, and assign several partitions to each node. For example, a database running on a cluster of 10 nodes may be split into 1,000 partitions from the outset so that approximately 100 partitions are assigned to each node. Now, if a node is added to the cluster, the new node can steal a few partitions from every existing node until partitions are fairly distributed once again.

Cassandra and Riak take a different approach: they use a gossip protocol among the nodes to disseminate any changes in cluster state. Requests can be sent to any node, and that node forwards them to the appropriate node for the requested partition (approach 1 in Figure 6-7). This model puts more complexity in the database nodes but avoids the dependency on an external coordination service such as ZooKeeper.

The database must potentially keep several different committed versions of an object, because various in-progress transactions may need to see the state of the database at different points in time. Because it maintains several versions of an object side by side, this technique is known as multi-version concurrency control (MVCC).

In the case of the doctor on call example, the row being modified in step 3 was one of the rows returned in step 1, so we could make the transaction safe and avoid write skew by locking the rows in step 1 (SELECT FOR UPDATE). However, the other four examples are different: they check for the absence of rows matching some search condition, and the write adds a row matching the same condition. If the query in step 1 doesn’t return any rows, SELECT FOR UPDATE can’t attach locks to anything.

Even better, rather than using configured constant timeouts, systems can continually measure response times and their variability (jitter), and automatically adjust timeouts according to the observed response time distribution. This can be done with a Phi Accrual failure detector [30], which is used for example in Akka and Cassandra

The quartz clock in a computer is not very accurate: it drifts (runs faster or slower than it should). Clock drift varies depending on the temperature of the machine. Google assumes a clock drift of 200 ppm (parts per million) for its servers [41], which is equivalent to 6 ms drift for a clock that is resynchronized with a server every 30 seconds, or 17 seconds drift for a clock that is resynchronized once a day.

Database writes can mysteriously disappear: a node with a lagging clock is unable to overwrite values previously written by a node with a fast clock until the clock skew between the nodes has elapsed [54, 55]. This scenario can cause arbitrary amounts of data to be silently dropped without any error being reported to the application.

However, if you want to allow people to also remove things from their carts, and not just add things, then taking the union of siblings may not yield the right result: if you merge two sibling carts and an item has been removed in only one of them, then the removed item will reappear in the union of the siblings [37].

This is the idea behind linearizability [6] (also known as atomic consistency [7], strong consistency, immediate consistency, or external consistency [8]). The exact definition of linearizability is quite subtle, and we will explore it in the rest of this section.

In a linearizable system we imagine that there must be some point in time (between the start and end of the write operation) at which the value of x atomically flips from 0 to 1. Thus, if one client’s read returns the new value 1, all subsequent reads must also return the new value, even if the write operation has not yet completed.

Linearizability is a recency guarantee on reads and writes of a register (an individual object). It doesn’t group operations together into transactions, so it does not prevent problems such as write skew (see “Write Skew and Phantoms”), unless you take additional measures such as materializing conflicts (see “Materializing conflicts”).

When using a lock or lease to protect access to some resource, such as the file storage in Figure 8-4, we need to ensure that a node that is under a false belief of being “the chosen one” cannot disrupt the rest of the system. A fairly simple technique that achieves this goal is called fencing, and is illustrated in Figure 8-5.

Let’s assume that every time the lock server grants a lock or lease, it also returns a fencing token, which is a number that increases every time a lock is granted (e.g., incremented by the lock service). We can then require that every time a client sends a write request to the storage service, it must include its current fencing token.

Read repair When a client makes a read from several nodes in parallel, it can detect any stale responses. For example, in Figure 5-10, user 2345 gets a version 6 value from replica 3 and a version 7 value from replicas 1 and 2. The client sees that replica 3 has a stale value and writes the newer value back to that replica. This approach works well for values that are frequently read. Anti-entropy process In addition, some datastores have a background process that constantly looks for differences in the data between replicas and copies any missing data from one replica to another. Unlike the replication log in leader-based replication, this anti-entropy process does not copy writes in any particular order, and there may be a significant delay before data is copied.

The algorithm works as follows: The server maintains a version number for every key, increments the version number every time that key is written, and stores the new version number along with the value written. When a client reads a key, the server returns all values that have not been overwritten, as well as the latest version number. A client must read a key before writing. When a client writes a key, it must include the version number from the prior read, and it must merge together all values that it received in the prior read. (The response from a write request can be like a read, returning all current values, which allows us to chain several writes like in the shopping cart example.) When the server receives a write with a particular version number, it can overwrite all values with that version number or below (since it knows that they have been merged into the new value), but it must keep all values with a higher version number (because those values are concurrent with the incoming write).

The key idea about Lamport timestamps, which makes them consistent with causality, is the following: every node and every client keeps track of the maximum counter value it has seen so far, and includes that maximum on every request. When a node receives a request or response with a maximum counter value greater than its own counter value, it immediately increases its own counter to that maximum.

Total order broadcast is usually described as a protocol for exchanging messages between nodes.

Total order broadcast is asynchronous: messages are guaranteed to be delivered reliably in a fixed order, but there is no guarantee about when a message will be delivered (so one recipient may lag behind the others).

You can sequence reads through the log by appending a message, reading the log, and performing the actual read when the message is delivered back to you. The message’s position in the log thus defines the point in time at which the read happens. (Quorum reads in etcd work somewhat like this [16].) If the log allows you to fetch the position of the latest log message in a linearizable way, you can query that position, wait for all entries up to that position to be delivered to you, and then perform the read.

You may have heard about the FLP result [68]—named after the authors Fischer, Lynch, and Paterson—which proves that there is no algorithm that is always able to reach consensus if there is a risk that a node may crash. In a distributed system, we must assume that nodes may crash, so reliable consensus is impossible. Yet, here we are, discussing algorithms for achieving consensus. What is going on here? The answer is that the FLP result is proved in the asynchronous system model (see “System Model and Reality”), a very restrictive model that assumes a deterministic algorithm that cannot use any clocks or timeouts.

All of the processing and parallel join algorithms that we discussed in the last few sections had already been implemented in so-called massively parallel processing (MPP) databases more than a decade previously [3, 40]. For example, the Gamma database machine, Teradata, and Tandem NonStop SQL were pioneers in this area

The biggest difference is that MPP databases focus on parallel execution of analytic SQL queries on a cluster of machines, while the combination of MapReduce and a distributed filesystem [19] provides something much more like a general-purpose operating system that can run arbitrary programs.

The Hadoop ecosystem includes both random-access OLTP databases such as HBase (see “SSTables and LSM-Trees”) and MPP-style analytic databases such as Impala [41]. Neither HBase nor Impala uses MapReduce, but both use HDFS for storage.

And this is why MapReduce is designed to tolerate frequent unexpected task termination: it’s not because the hardware is particularly unreliable, it’s because the freedom to arbitrarily terminate processes enables better resource utilization in a computing cluster.

Spark, Flink, and Tez avoid writing intermediate state to HDFS, so they take a different approach to tolerating faults: if a machine fails and the intermediate state on that machine is lost, it is recomputed from other data that is still available (a prior intermediary stage if possible, or otherwise the original input data, which is normally on HDFS).

A sorting operation inevitably needs to consume its entire input before it can produce any output, because it’s possible that the very last input record is the one with the lowest key and thus needs to be the very first output record.

Broadcast hash joins One of the two join inputs is small, so it is not partitioned and it can be entirely loaded into a hash table. Thus, you can start a mapper for each partition of the large join input, load the hash table for the small input into each mapper, and then scan over the large input one record at a time, querying the hash table for each record.

What happens if the producers send messages faster than the consumers can process them? Broadly speaking, there are three options: the system can drop messages, buffer messages in a queue, or apply backpressure (also known as flow control; i.e., blocking the producer from sending more messages).

A hopping window also has a fixed length, but allows windows to overlap in order to provide some smoothing. For example, a 5-minute window with a hop size of 1 minute would contain the events between 10:03:00 and 10:07:59, then the next window would cover events between 10:04:00 and 10:08:59, and so on.

Surprisingly often I see software engineers make statements like, “In my experience, 99% of people only need X” or “…don’t need X” (for various values of X). I think that such statements say more about the experience of the speaker than about the actual usefulness of a technology. The range of different things you might want to do with data is dizzyingly wide. What one person considers to be an obscure and pointless feature may well be a central requirement for someone else.

For example, consider a social networking service, and two users who were in a relationship but have just broken up. One of the users removes the other as a friend, and then sends a message to their remaining friends complaining about their ex-partner. The user’s intention is that their ex-partner should not see the rude message, since the message was sent after the friend status was revoked.

For example, consider a social networking service, and two users who were in a relationship but have just broken up. One of the users removes the other as a friend, and then sends a message to their remaining friends complaining about their ex-partner. The user’s intention is that their ex-partner should not see the rude message, since the message was sent after the friend status was revoked. However, in a system that stores friendship status in one place and messages in another place, that ordering dependency between the unfriend event and the message-send event may be lost. If the causal dependency is not captured, a service that sends notifications about new messages may process the message-send event before the unfriend event, and thus incorrectly send a notification to the ex-partner.

Whenever a batch, stream, or ETL process transports data from one place and form to another place and form, it is acting like the database subsystem that keeps indexes or materialized views up to date. Viewed like this, batch and stream processors are like elaborate implementations of triggers, stored procedures, and materialized view maintenance routines.

To make the operation idempotent through several hops of network communication, it is not sufficient to rely just on a transaction mechanism provided by a database—you need to consider the end-to-end flow of the request. For example, you could generate a unique identifier for an operation (such as a UUID) and include it as a hidden form field in the client application, or calculate a hash of all the relevant form fields to derive the operation ID [3]. If the web browser submits the POST request twice, the two requests will have the same operation ID. You can then pass that operation ID all the way through to the database and check that you only ever execute one operation with a given ID, as shown in Example 12-2.

The end-to-end argument This scenario of suppressing duplicate transactions is just one example of a more general principle called the end-to-end argument, which was articulated by Saltzer, Reed, and Clark in 1984 [55]: The function in question can completely and correctly be implemented only with the knowledge and help of the application standing at the endpoints of the communication system. Therefore, providing that questioned function as a feature of the communication system itself is not possible. (Sometimes an incomplete version of the function provided by the communication system may be useful as a performance enhancement.)

Mature systems similarly tend to consider the possibility of unlikely things going wrong, and manage that risk. For example, large-scale storage systems such as HDFS and Amazon S3 do not fully trust disks: they run background processes that continually read back files, compare them to other replicas, and move files from one disk to another, in order to mitigate the risk of silent corruption

Surveillance As a thought experiment, try replacing the word data with surveillance, and observe if common phrases still sound so good [93]. How about this: “In our surveillance-driven organization we collect real-time surveillance streams and store them in our surveillance warehouse.

For Roth, the state is a myth, which, like other myths (Christianity, Judaism, the Austrian Idea), is an organizer of experience, a net of stories and images in which we catch our lives, and understand them. When such a myth fails, nothing is left: no meaning, no emotion, even. Disasters in Roth's books tend to occur quietly, modestly.

Anyone who wants to know the full, surprising contents of the Gnostic Gospels—with hermaphroditic spirits, and a Demiurge (not God) creating the universe, and the story of the Fall told from the point of view of the serpent, a friend to mankind—should consult Elaine Pagels's classic The Gnostic Gospels (1979) or Marvin Meyer's The Gnostic Discoveries: The Impact of the Nag Hammadi Library (2005). Meyer is more descriptive, Pagels more analytic. What is important for this story is that Mary Magdalene is a central figure in the Gnostic Gospels and, compared with her European legend, an utterly new character. Not only is she not a prostitute; she is an evangelical hero and Christ's favorite disciple.

He felt anguished in an undefinable, helpless way that he knew indicated complex problems with his psyche. Previously, Yangmingshan had been a fun topic; it was the site of one of the earliest known instances of cannabis use by humans; for weeks, Li and his parents had discussed finding cannabis, harvesting some, and photographing the location for future harvests, but now they were there and hadn’t mentioned cannabis at all.

When Balanchine's oldest fans speak of certain moments—of Maria Tallchief in The Firebird, gliding across the dark stage, putting the monsters to sleep, or of Tanaquil LeClercq in Western Symphony, wearing her sexy black hat and banging out fouettés—it seems to me that this is what they mean: theater that isn't just a show but something immediate, unfakable.

Yes, Cheez Whiz, or whatever it was called in 1942. "In a time of peril and unspoken fear," she explains, cheese, any cheese, is "an anesthetic…. Put alittle bit on crackers, or on crisp toast if your oven is still working. Try it on a tired factory worker some day, or a nervous neighbor, with a glass of milk if possible or a cup of tea, and watch the unfolding of a lot of spiritual tendrils that were drawn up into a tight heedless tangle."

Caselli loved P. with a bitter, polemical love. Apparently he had been faithful to him for forty years; he was his shadow, his earthbound incarnation, and, like all those who perform vicarial functions, he was an interesting human specimen: like those, I mean to say, who represent Authority without possessing any of their own, such as, for example, sacristans, museum guides, beadles, nurses, the “young men” working for lawyers and notaries, and salesmen. These people, to a greater or lesser degree, tend to transfuse the human substance of their chief into their own mold, as occurs with pseudomorphic crystals: sometimes they suffer from it, often they enjoy it, and they possess two distinct patterns of behavior, depending on whether they act on their own or “in the exercise of their function.” It often happens that the personality of their chief invades them so completely as to disturb their normal human contacts and so they remain celibate: celibacy is in fact prescribed and accepted in the monastic state, which entails precisely the proximity and subjection to the highest authority.

The course notes contained a detail which at first reading had escaped me, namely, that the so tender and delicate zinc, so yielding to acid which gulps it down in a single mouthful, behaves, however, in a very different fashion when it is very pure: then it obstinately resists the attack. One could draw from this two conflicting philosophical conclusions: the praise of purity, which protects from evil like a coat of mail; the praise of impurity, which gives rise to changes, in other words, to life.

So the thermometer halted for a long time at 95 degrees and then began to climb again. Lanza remained close to the fire, and since, with the warmth, sleep began pressing in on him again, he permitted it softly to invade some of the rooms of his consciousness. But not that which stood behind his eyes and watched the thermometer: that must remain wide awake. With a sulfodiene one never knows, but for the moment everything was going properly. Lanza enjoyed the quiet rest, going along with the dance of thoughts and images that is the prelude to sleep, yet avoiding being overcome by it. It was hot, and Lanza saw his hometown—his wife, his son, his field, the tavern. The warm breath of the tavern, the heavy breath of the stable. Water trickled into the stable with every rainstorm, water that came from above, from the hayloft—perhaps from a crack in the wall, because all the roof tiles (he had checked them himself at Easter) were in perfect condition. There is room for another cow, but (here everything became fogged over by a mist of sketchy and unfinished calculations). Every minute of work put ten lire into his pocket: now he felt as if the fire was roaring for him, that the mixer was turning for him, like a machine to make money.

The government had orchestrated a ceremony for the divergence of the Blue Nile, as the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam had reached a milestone in its construction. The Blue Nile is one of the Nile’s tributaries, snaking its way down from the Ethiopian Highlands to Sudan, where it meets the White Nile. The dam will be the largest hydroelectric facility in Africa, generating a projected 6,450 megawatts and carrying a price tag of around $5 billion. That’s a lot of power, considering Ethiopia’s current electricity generation is around 4,000 megawatts, for one hundred million people.8 But there are ongoing fears in Egypt, and from analysts around the world, about how it will impact Egypt’s water supply, given that 90 percent of Egyptians rely on the Nile.

Understanding how the global land rush intersected the last decade’s biofuel boom can help us see why projections around the scale-up of bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration are so concerning. In 2007 and 2008, food and oil prices both spiked. Assessments vary as to the causes for the underlying price spikes: financialization of food markets and weather played some role, as did diversion of food crops (soy, maize, sugar) and land area toward biofuel production.

From a biofuel standpoint, seaweed is an attractive feedstock because it doesn’t contain lignin, the structure-giving component of plants that is expensive to break down.

(Another way seaweed might mitigate climate change isn’t as biofuels, but as cattle feed: one lab-based study found that adding a specific seaweed species to the diet of cattle—Asparagopsis taxiformis, which contains a compound that inhibits methane formation—could reduce cows’ methane production by 99 percent. Scaling this cattle superfood up toward 2 percent of a cows’ diet, globally, would take a sizable seaweed cultivation industry.)

To sequester one gigaton of carbon dioxide, one would have to afforest 70 to 90 million hectares, or a land area about twice the size of California.19 Now, again, current emissions are forty gigatons of carbon dioxide. So that’s a tremendous effort just to put away one gigaton. A few gigatons are certainly doable, since there’s a lot of farmland that’s been abandoned because of low productivity; one conservative estimate put the acreage at around the size of India.20 Scientists calculate that there are large areas of land available for reforestation—from 500 million hectares in bottom-up estimates, to between 1 and 3 billion hectares in modeled estimates of nonagricultural land broadly.

The other ex situ approach involves excavating rocks, grinding them up, and spreading the rock powder on fields. This is colloquially known as “rocks for crops.” The rocks-for-crops idea enhances weathering by increasing the surface area of the material via the crushing and grinding. The biological activity in soils also can speed up weathering. (Again, we witness the wonders of soil microbes!) Ground-up rocks dissolve one to five times faster when plants are around.3 West remarks, “It’s actually a pretty interesting idea because it has the potential benefit of providing nutrients to crops, too, so you can get a double whammy, especially in developing countries where fertilizers are a little more scarce or more expensive relative to the value of the crops.” Right now, a research team from the Leverhulme Centre for Climate Change Mitigation in the UK is conducting mesoscale field trials in Illinois, Australia, and Malayasian Borneo to figure out if this is something that works on a five-to-ten-year timescale.

As science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson writes, it may be easy to imagine a radically different society, “in that one merely expresses wishes and defines some version of justice, equality, peace. That’s all easy. What’s hard is imagining any plausible way of getting from here to there.”2 Robinson writes that perhaps when Marxist theorist Fredric Jameson talks about the future as being “unimaginable,” he doesn’t mean that the future is an unimaginable destination; what’s unimaginable is “a history to a good future place.”

In 2017, the geoengineering research program in China held the first geoengineering research course in Beijing for scientists from the developing world. They provided model results for the entire earth system for students to analyze, because they believed students would best understand how to select the model parameters that were most important in their country. “It should not be some sort of teacher and student thing,” clarifies project leader John Moore at Beijing Normal University, speaking about international collaboration more broadly. “It should be an equal relationship.” He explains, “The international collaboration, and everybody being a sort of fair and equal partner, is a big priority from the Chinese viewpoint.” China has no wish to do geoengineering unilaterally, and wants to avoid being seen as eager to geoengineer, he says. I ask him why he thinks that the Chinese are so interested in international cooperation.

Nor is time granted oftener to empires than to men to learn from past errors. Although a weaver would wish to mend his web or a clever calculator would correct his mistakes, and the artist would try to retouch his masterpiece if still imperfect or slightly damaged, Nature prefers to start again from the very clay, from chaos itself, and this horrible waste is what we term natural order.

Those who put the historical novel in a category apart are forgetting that what every novelist does is only to interpret, by means of the techniques which his period affords, a certain number of past events; his memories, whether consciously or unconsciously recalled, whether personal or impersonal, are all woven of the same stuff as History itself.

Only a few students of human destiny will understand. In our time the novel devours all other forms; one is almost forced to use it as the medium of expression. This study of the destiny of a man called Hadrian would have been cast in the form of a tragedy in the Seventeenth Century, or of an essay, perhaps, in the period of the Renaissance.

None of us were born among the torturers, for none are. It is said that in ancient times there were both men and women in the guild, and that sons and daughters were born to them and brought up in the mystery, as is now the case among the lamp-makers and the goldsmiths and many other guilds. But Ymar the Almost Just, observing how cruel the women were and how often they exceeded the punishments he had decreed, ordered that there should be women among the torturers no more.

Now I have traveled much farther from our tower, but I have found always that the pattern of our guild is repeated mindlessly (like the repetitions of Father Inire’s mirrors in the House Absolute) in the societies of every trade, so that they are all of them torturers, just as we. His quarry stands to the hunter as our clients to us; those who buy to the tradesman; the enemies of the Commonwealth to the soldier; the governed to the governors; men to women. All love that which they destroy.

Gurloes was one of the most complex men I have known, because he was a complex man trying to be simple. Not a simple, but a complex man’s idea of simplicity. Just as a courtier forms himself into something brilliant and involved, midway between a dancing master and a diplomacist, with a touch of assassin if needed, so Master Gurloes had shaped himself to be the dull creature a pursuivant or bailiff expected to see when he summoned the head of our guild, and that is the only thing a real torturer cannot be.

Of the one son, Phineas, the hero of the following pages, the mother and five sisters were very proud. The doctor was accustomed to say that his goose was as good as any other man's goose, as far as he could see as yet; but that he should like some very strong evidence before he allowed himself to express an opinion that the young bird partook, in any degree, of the qualities of a swan. From which it may be gathered that Dr. Finn was a man of common-sense.

Everything foul lay in tumbled heaps ten times and more the height of the baluchither’s lofty back—obscene statues, canted and crumbling, and human bones to which strips of dry flesh and hanks of hair still clung. And with them ten thousand men and women; those who, in seeking a private resurrection, had rendered their corpses forever imperishable lay here like drunkards after their debauch, their crystal sarcophagi broken, their limbs relaxed in grotesque disarray, their clothing rotted or rotting, and their eyes blindly fixed upon the sky.

Too, ever since that night, when I think of her without thinking also of a particular time and place, the Thecla who rises in my imagination stands before a mirror in a shimmering gown of frost-white that scarcely covers her breasts but falls in ever changing cascades below her waist. I see her poised for a moment there; both hands reach up to touch our face. Then she is whirled away in a room whose walls and ceiling and floor are all of mirrors. No doubt it is her own memory of her image in those mirrors that I see, but after a step or two she vanishes into the dark and I see her no more.

But I was young, and though it would be better to confine oneself to women nearer one’s own station, still there are times—as you would understand, young man, if you had ever been in my position—when a little maid or country girl, who can be wooed with a handful of silver or a bolt of velvet, and will not demand, at the most inconvenient moment, the death of some rival or an ambassadorship for her husband … Well, when a little person like that becomes a most enticing proposition.

Then, in the moment more that I watched (for I soon recovered enough self-command to flee that mad fight) I saw several figures throw aside their capes and—as it appeared—their faces too. Under those faces, which when they were no longer worn seemed of a tissue as insubstantial as that of the notules, were such monstrosities as I had not thought existence could support: a circular mouth rimmed with needle teeth; eyes that were themselves a thousand eyes, clustered like the scales of a pine cone; jaws like tongs.

Similarly, the word was not often applied to the Indonesian mistreatment of the East Timorese, who were subjected to another wave of terror as Indonesia tried to prevent or defeat a U.N.-sponsored referendum on independence in 1999. The United States, after helping Suharto take power in 1965 in one of the great bloodbaths of the twentieth century,30 and after supporting his dictatorship for thirty-two years, also gave him crucial military and diplomatic aid when he invaded and occupied East Timor from 1975.31 In 1999, as Indonesia attempted to prevent the independence referendum in East Timor by violence, the United States maintained its military aid programs and refused to intervene to stop the killing, on the ground that what is happening “is the responsibility of the government of Indonesia, and we don’t want to take that responsibility away from them” (as stated by Defense Secretary William Cohen in a press conference of September 8, 1999).

The large-scale application of chemical weapons, and napalm, in Vietnam was confined to the South. One reason for this was that North Vietnam had a government with links to other countries, so that the use of these barbarous and illegal weapons against it would have been widely publicized. South Vietnam was occupied by the United States and its client regime, so that the victimized people of the South were voiceless and could be treated with unlimited savagery.

During the 1980s, the Reagan administration mounted a major propaganda campaign over alleged victims of “Yellow Rain” in Cambodia and Laos, claiming that chemical warfare had been employed there by the Soviet Union through its Vietnam proxy. This propaganda effort eventually collapsed following the U.S. Army’s own inability to confirm this warfare and, more important, the finding that the alleged Yellow Rain was bee feces, not chemicals.72 Nevertheless, this campaign received vastly more publicity than the real and large-scale chemical warfare carried out by the United States in Indochina. The Wall Street Journal, which had heavily featured Yellow Rain and expressed the greatest indignation at this display of Communist evil, never mentioned the U.S. employment of chemicals in that area during its Yellow Rain campaign. The Journal’s publisher, Peter Kann, eventually wrote that the Vietnam war record had clarified “who were the good guys and who were the bad guys,” definitively shown by “the poisoned fields of Laos” (his euphemism for Yellow Rain).73 In short, Kann places the massive real-world use of chemical warfare by the United States in Orwell’s black hole and demonstrates Communist evil by putting forward the discredited claim of Yellow Rain that his paper has still not admitted to be fraudulent.

In December 1994, only eleven months after NAFTA went into effect, Mexico suffered a major financial crisis, including a massive flight of capital, a devaluation of the currency, and a subsequent bailout by the IMF that required Mexico to carry out painful deflationary measures.

In December 1994, only eleven months after NAFTA went into effect, Mexico suffered a major financial crisis, including a massive flight of capital, a devaluation of the currency, and a subsequent bailout by the IMF that required Mexico to carry out painful deflationary measures. Despite the fact that the meltdown occurred within a year of the introduction of NAFTA, which the media had portrayed as ushering in a prospective golden age of economic advance, they were unanimous that NAFTA was not to blame.

In a notable illustration of the applicability of the propaganda model, the nine-month-long Pittston miners’ strike that began in April 1989 was accorded much less attention, and less friendly treatment, than the Soviet miners’ strikes of the summer of that same year.

From 1977 through 1999, while the incomes of the top 1 percent of households grew by 84.8 percent and the top 10 percent by 44.6 percent, the bottom 60 percent lost ground and the income of the lowest 20 percent fell by 12.5 percent.125 Real hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees (i.e., the 80 percent of the workforce that holds working-class jobs) fell by 4.8 percent between 1973 and 1999.126 This, along with the adverse trend of social indicators in the same period,127 suggests that the welfare of the majority declined in this era of high employment, a “new economy,” and a spectacular upswing in the stock market. In its euphoria phase, which ended abruptly with the collapse of the dot.com market in 1999 and 2000, the mainstream media hardly noticed that only a minority had been the beneficiaries;128 they briefly discovered this issue only under the impetus of Pat Buchanan’s rightwing populist outcries during the 1996 presidential election campaign.

We don’t know the city but as soon as we see the window, the Formica table in the corner, the curtains with thick folds that smell of beer and cigarettes, we know that this bar in Pennsylvania stands on the steep slope of misery. Not the kind of misery that is filled with drama, not grandiose misery pinned on History’s lapel, just the kind of dull misery that smells of checkered fabric hanging in the windows of a provincial bar.

She escaped from there when she ran off to join Robert Brown’s Science Circus, where she earned $2 a show doing acrobatics to demonstrate simple laws of applied physics. She arrived in New York in 1949, seventeen years old and already quite knowing when it came to men.

Breathless, Belmondo puts it this way: “Women are never going to want to do in eight seconds’ time what they will be more than happy to do in eight days’ time”). I find out that Kazan kept trying to break up with her; and that in 1967 he married her.

That is the only reason Barbara made films. To soothe. To heal the pain, assuage the humiliation, process the fear. “Wanda’s character is based on my own life and on my character, and also on the way I understand other people’s lives. Everything comes from my own experience. Everything I do is me.”

And no doubt one bright morning, a still and radiant day, she too had once stood like Clarissa Dalloway at eighteen, “musing among the vegetables,” full of hope on a glorious spring morning as she looked toward the sky, watching the birds swoop through the air, mistaking a brief moment of abundance for the promise of long-lasting happiness.

I was reminded that only in unfamiliar bedrooms do we perceive with such clarity the true nature of our existence—true because astray—only away from our own bedroom, from the room that I longed for every moment of my trip—how I longed to be there, to slip into it—in the persistently unyielding space of a deserted place that just won’t be appropriated.

Wanda is perched on the car hood, they are drinking beer and whiskey, dogs are barking. Even the most deserted wasteland, the most miserable place, can outwit fright in a last stand; it needs no more than a pebble to sustain dusk’s insubstantial loveliness, and sadness; ignorance and deception are momentarily appeased in a last trick of the light.

it’s odd how men like their women to be a little brazen, confident in their own capacity for pleasure; it reassures them, relieves them of uncertainty and regret, and of course girls like that did whatever they had to do to earn a bit of recognition, a scrap of autonomy, but Kazan didn’t see, he didn’t want to see what Barbara was really interested in. The typical 1970s woman is a woman who’s wondering what she’s actually going to be able to do with the freedom that everyone keeps telling her about; a woman who wonders what new lie she’ll have to make up now, how she’s going to pretend to be cool, so that all these men will finally leave her the hell alone.

Earlier he had talked to me at great length about his doctoral thesis on these holy places, the American Holy Land. It was relaxing to listen to him talking about sources, structures, and annexes. Now he was struggling against some inner collapse, he was sick of himself, which actually made him rather likable.

When he had believed he was going to die, the idea of never having a woman to love him had summed up all his pain. Now, as he sat there with the flask empty on the linoleum at his feet, he checked himself and found his ache was missing. The world was dull or annoying to him, and she was just like any other female, he felt: she had certain functions. And he had seen those functions turned inside out by high explosives, he knew what was inside people, and there was nothing there. It was gross. It was boring. It was sickening and that was all. The loss of this feeling horrified him. It was yet another thing that didn’t work on him. When I was younger, I always wanted to be in love with somebody someday. The thought that that was over, that I couldn’t feel that anymore, this really hit me hard. It took my hope away.

In the fish, the long duration of these preliminaries, their ritual character and above all their great show of colour finery and fin development which at first only serve to subdue the opponent, mask, for the uninitiated, the seriousness of the situation. On account of their beauty, the fighters appear less malevolent than they really are and one is just as loth to ascribe to them embittered courage and contempt of death as one is to associate head-hunting with the almost effeminately beautiful Indonesian warriors.

In order to ascertain objectively whether an animal recognizes its mate personally, the latter must be substituted, in experiment, by another of the same sex and in exactly the same phase of the reproductive cycle. If, for instance, in a pair of birds just beginning to nest, we replace the female by one that is already in the psycho-physiological phase of feeding its young, its instinctive behaviour will naturally fail to harmonize with that of the male. If the male then reacts inimically, it is impossible to say whether he really notices that the substituted female is not his wife or whether it merely annoys him that she behaves “wrongly”.

If you are worried by such considerations, you can find many other creatures of lower mental development which are less “expensive” from an emotional point of view, and yet are “something to love”: for instance, that most easily kept of our indigenous birds, the starling. An extraordinarily understanding friend used to describe him as “the poor man’s dog”. That is entirely appropriate.

All expressions of animal emotions, for instance, the “Kia” and “Kiaw” note of the jackdaw, are therefore not comparable to our spoken language, but only to those expressions such as yawning, wrinkling the brow and smiling, which are expressed unconsciously as innate actions and also understood by a corresponding inborn mechanism. The “words” of the various animal “languages” are merely interjections.

The scientist only let the bird fly freely when he had just watched it have an evacuation of the bowels, so that, for the next ten minutes, his well-kept furniture was not endangered. The parakeet learned very quickly to associate these facts and, as he was passionately fond of leaving his cage, he would force out a minute dropping with all his might, every time Prof. von Frisch came near the cage. He even squeezed desperately when it was impossible to produce anything, and really threatened to do himself an injury by the violence of his straining.

All shrews are particularly difficult to keep; this is not because, as we are led proverbially to believe, they are hard to tame, but because the metabolism of these smallest of mammals is so very fast that they will die of hunger within two or three hours if the food supply fails. Since they feed exclusively on small, living animals, mostly insects, and demand, of these, considerably more than their own weight every day, they are most exacting charges.

To me it is a strangely appealing and even elevating thought that the age-old covenant between man and dog was “signed” voluntarily and without obligation by each of the contracting parties. All other domestic animals, like some slaves of ancient times, became house-servants only after having served a term of true imprisonment, all, that is, with the exception of the cat; for the cat is not really a domesticated animal and his chief charm lies in the fact that, even to-day, he still walks by himself. Neither the dog nor the cat is a slave, but only the dog is a friend—granted, a submissive and servile friend.

Contrary to the wide-spread opinion that the wolf plays an essential role in the ancestry of the larger dog breeds, comparative research in behaviour has revealed the fact that all European dogs, including the largest ones, such as Great Danes and wolfhounds, are pure Aureus and contain, at the most, a minute amount of wolf’s blood.

Many of the characteristics in which domestic animals differ from their wild ancestral form arise by virtue of the fact that properties of body structure and behaviour, which in the wild prototype are only marked by some transient stages of youth, are kept permanently by the domestic form. In dogs, short hair, curly tail, hanging ears, domed skulls and the short muzzle of many domestic breeds are features of this type. In behaviour, one of these juvenile characters which has become permanent in the domestic dog, expresses itself in the peculiar form of its attachment. The ardent affection which wild canine youngsters show for their mother and which in these disappears completely after they have reached maturity, is preserved as a permanent mental trait of all highly domesticated dogs. What originally was love for the mother is transformed into love for the human master.

Birds reared in isolation from their kind do not generally know which species they belong to; that is to say, not only their social reactions but also their sexual desires are directed towards those beings with whom they have spent certain impressionable phases of their early youth. Consequently, birds raised singly by hand tend to regard human beings, and human beings only, as potential partners in all reproductive activities. And this is exactly what Jock did.

To the connoisseur this is something quite remarkable.

The little fellow shows off a beard and unfolds tail feathers whose conspicuous colouring will not become evident until two months later.

Pastimes and games are substitutes for the real living of real intimacy. Because of this they may be regarded as preliminary engagements rather than as unions, which is why they are characterized as poignant forms of play. Intimacy begins when individual (usually instinctual) programming becomes more intense, and both social patterning and ulterior restrictions and motives begin to give way. It is the only completely satisfying answer to stimulus-hunger, recognition-hunger and structure-hunger. Its prototype is the act of loving impregnation.

A large cocktail party often functions as a kind of gallery for the exhibition of pastimes. In one corner of the room a few people are playing "PTA," another corner is the forum for "Psychiatry," a third is the theater for "Ever Been" or "What Became," the fourth is engaged for "General Motors," and the buffet is reserved for women who want to play "Kitchen" or "Wardrobe."

At the end of the party, each person will have selected certain players he would like to see more of, while others he will discard, regardless of how skillfully or pleasantly they each engaged in the pastime. The ones he selects are those who seem the most likely candidates for more complex relationships—that is, games.

In special cases the Adult overrides the Child in the selection process. This is most clearly illustrated by an insurance salesman who carefully learns to play social pastimes. While he is playing, his Adult listens for possible prospects and selects them from the players as people he would like to see more of. Their adeptness at games or congeniality is quite irrelevant to his process of selection, which is based, as in most cases, on peripheral factors—in this instance, financial readiness.

"Beautiful friendships" are often based on the fact that the players complement each other with great economy and satisfaction, so that there is a maximum yield with a minimum effort from the games they play with each other. Certain intermediate, precautionary or concessional moves can be eluded, giving a high degree of elegance to the relationship. The effort saved on defensive maneuvers can be devoted to ornamental flourishes instead, to the delight of both parries and sometimes of the onlookers as well.

If she is actually playing a game of "Harried," however, it will be very difficult for her to adhere to this principle. In that case the husband is carefully chosen; he is an otherwise reasonable man who will criticize his wife if she is not as efficient as he thinks his mother was. In effect, she marries his fantasy of his mother as perpetuated in his Parent, which is similar to her fantasy of her mother or grandmother.

White makes a subtly derogatory remark about Mrs. White, disguised as an anecdote, and ends: "Isn't that right, sweetheart?" Mrs. White tends to agree for two ostensibly Adult reasons: (a) because the anecdote itself is, in the main, accurately reported, and to disagree about what is presented as a peripheral detail (but is really the essential point of the transaction) would seem pedantic; (b) because it would seem surly to disagree with a man who calls one "sweetheart" in public. The psychological reason for her agreement, however, is her depressive position. She married him precisely because she knew he would perform this service for her: exposing her deficiencies and thus saving her from the embarrassment of having to expose them herself. Her parents accommodated her the same way when she was little.

This game is the source of a large percentage of petty dissension in everyday life; it is played from the depressive Child position "I am no good," which is protectively transformed into the Parental position "They are no good." The player's transactional problem is, then, to prove the latter thesis. Hence "Blemish" players do not feel comfortable with a new person until they have found his blemish.

As in most games, White, who makes the first move, wins either way. If Black shows his anger, White can feel justified in returning the resentment. If Black restrains himself, White can go on enjoying his opportunities.

A woman comes into a strange group and after a very short time raises her leg, exposing herself in a provocative way, and remarks, "Oh my, I have a run in my stocking."

Unit serves a similar purpose to void in programming languages like C and Java. In Scala, every method has to return some value as long as it doesn’t crash or hang. But main doesn’t return anything meaningful, so there’s a special type Unit that is the return type of such methods. There’s only one value of this type and the literal syntax for it is (), a pair of empty parentheses, pronounced “unit” just like the type. Usually a return type of Unit is a hint that the method has a side effect

Note that even an expression like 2 + 1 is just calling a member of an object. In that case, what we’re calling is the + member of the object 2. It’s really syntactic sugar for the expression 2.+(1), which passes 1 as an argument to the method + on the object 2. Scala has no special notion of operators. It’s simply the case that + is a valid method name in Scala. Any method name can be used infix like that (omitting the dot and parentheses) when calling it with a single argument. For example, instead of MyModule.abs(42) we can say MyModule abs 42 and get the same result. You can use whichever you find more pleasing in any given case

A call is said to be in tail position if the caller does nothing other than return the value of the recursive call. For example, the recursive call to go(n-1,n*acc) we discussed earlier is in tail position, since the method returns the value of this recursive call directly and does nothing else with it

Therefore, functional data structures are by definition immutable. For example, the empty list (written List() or Nil in Scala) is as eternal and immutable as the integer values 3 or 4. And just as evaluating 3 + 4 results in a new number 7 without modifying either 3 or 4, concatenating two lists together (the syntax for this is a ++ b for two lists a and b) yields a new list and leaves the two inputs unmodified

Inside apply, the argument as will be bound to a Seq[A] (documentation at http://mng.bz/ f4k9), which has the functions head (returns the first element) and tail (returns all elements but the first).

Since lists are immutable, we don’t need to actually copy xs; we can just reuse it. This is called data sharing. Sharing of immutable data often lets us implement functions more efficiently; we can always return immutable data structures without having to worry about subsequent code modifying our data.

The worst part is there's no flattery involved in rape; I mean, it doesn't much matter what the females look like; it doesn't even seem to matter either if they have four legs instead of two. Dairy farmers have raped their cows even. "It's great to fuck a cow," they say, "you can fit everything in... the balls... everything."

After facing death, I became a young novelist and wrote a book about the Jonestown Pennsylvania flood in 1830 something, where Clara Barton threw her weight around. I did research. Clara Barton was the American version of Florence Nightingale. She was a nurse in Gettysburg during the Civil War, just like Ms. Nightingale in the Crimean War... or some old war over there. On Barton's hemlines there were always blood stains and she carried morphine in her pockets. She wasn't as much of a tramp as Florence Nightingale, though, Nightingale spread syphilis to all the European soldiers, but Barton was probably an American pioneer celibate.

Ten years later, at the beginning of 1969, I was in a mental hospital in San Francisco, having been committed by my roommates. They did it out of desperation; they'd tried everything including potatoes, nature's tranquilizers: au gratin, mashed, boiled, baked and fried.

Lise has started reciting her list over again from the beginning, when the maid does appear with a question-mark on her face. Lise puts down the receiver rather loudly and points to the light which the maid tries for herself, then, nodding her understanding of the case, makes to leave. ‘Wait!’ says Lise, first in English then in French, to neither of which the maid responds. Lise produces the glass with its Alka-Seltzers nestled at the bottom. ‘Filthy!’ Lise says in English. The maid obligingly fills the glass from the tap and hands it to Lise. ‘Dirty!’ Lise shouts in French. The maid understands, laughs at the happening, and this time makes a quick getaway with the glass in her hand.

Mrs Fiedke marvels benevolently while Lise bashfully plays with crumbs on the tablecloth. The waiter brings the rainbow ice and while Lise lifts the spoon to start Mrs Fiedke says, ‘It matches with your outfit.’ Lise laughs at this, longer than Mrs Fiedke had evidently expected. ‘Beautiful colours,’ Mrs Fiedke offers, as one might offer a cough-sweet. Lise sits before the brightly streaked ice-cream with her spoon in her hand and laughs on. Mrs Fiedke looks frightened, and more frightened as the voices of the bar stop to watch the laughing one; Mrs Fiedke shrinks into her old age, her face dry and wrinkled, her eyes gone into a far retreat, not knowing what to do. Lise stops suddenly and says, ‘That was funny.’

‘Too much self-control, which arises from fear and timidity, that’s what’s wrong with them. They’re cowards, most of them.’ ‘Oh, I always believe that,’ says Mrs Fiedke. ‘No doubt about it. The male sex.’

The whole concept, which you’ll learn as the centerpiece of this book, is called Tactical Empathy. This is listening as a martial art, balancing the subtle behaviors of emotional intelligence and the assertive skills of influence, to gain access to the mind of another person. Contrary to popular opinion, listening is not a passive activity. It is the most active thing you can do.

Then we would watch TV until we fell asleep. Around four in the morning I usually woke with a start. I would get up from my chair, clear the dirty dishes from the table, wash them, straighten the living room, clean the kitchen, put another blanket over my brother, turn down the TV, go to the window and look out into the street with its double row of parked cars: I couldn’t believe that it was still night, that this incandescence was night.

Even I couldn’t deny that their conduct had been impeccable for the five days they’d stayed with us. They always washed the dishes, three times they made dinner themselves, and they didn’t try anything with me, which was important. I could sense the interest in their eyes, in the way they moved, and the way they talked to me, but I also noted their self-control and found it flattering.

With the Bolognan (and the Libyan) it was different, because they shared meals with us, slept in my parents’ room, and watched me from up close in a way that no one (except my brother) ever had. What do they see? I wondered. What face, what eyes do they see? I didn’t wonder this very often, but once or twice I did. Now I know that there’s no such thing as closeness. One person’s eyes are always shut. The first person sees and the second doesn’t. Or the second person sees and the first doesn’t. Only a mother can be close, but that was unknown territory back then. A blank space. There was only the illusion of closeness.

I worked, did the shopping, cooked, watched TV, went with my brother to rent videos. Some nights I looked out the window and the night was as bright as day. Sometimes I thought that I was losing my mind, that it couldn’t be normal, such brightness, but deep down I knew I would never lose my mind.

I saw the shadowy negative of romantic situations. I saw the negative of passionate moments whose point of reference was always a TV series or the whispering of girls now forgotten. Sometimes I saw the negative of a whole life: a bigger house, a different neighborhood, children, a better job, time passing, old age, a grandchild, death in the public hospital or covered with a sheet in my parents’ bed, a bed that I would have liked to hear creak, like an ocean liner as it goes down, but that instead was silent as a tomb.

But when I got home they were always there, the house spotless, because they made it their job to cheerfully do everything that I used to do. Cheerfully, I say, and gladly, though I knew perfectly well that it was a fake cheer, as fake as mine, that their apparent good will hid feelings of emptiness, of sadness and grief in the face of the void. But they worked around the house. Dinner was always ready, the bathroom scoured with bleach, the rooms tidy. As if with these gestures they were saying to me: we aren’t shiftless, we seem shiftless but we aren’t, in fact if it was up to us we would do everything we could to make you happy.

Sometimes I thought it was a good thing that he had gone blind, because that way he would never see me, never see my face, never see the look on my face when I was with him, which wasn’t the look of a prostitute or a thief or a spy, but an expectant look, the look of someone hoping for anything and everything, from a kind word to a life-changing declaration.

I listen to others more than most people, sometimes at my peril, though I hope to learn something, but often I don’t or what I learn is of no consequence, though it might be to the person who spoke, yet many people tell the same stories again and again, which represent them best or are in some way significant and come to define them, but if they didn’t repeat them, they wouldn’t in any way define them, or matter, or be of any discernible consequence, since often it is what is not said that is of consequence.

Sometimes there is nothing to do other than resist or fight, but some people are locked inside their own wreckage and can’t do either. Sometimes an individual must fight or flee, if able and not already irrevocably ruined or paralyzed by a past that can’t be recovered, because there is no other possibility to survive than to fight, in some way, for what’s needed or wanted, though some people would never fight or don’t ever feel personally threatened, but when they do, when an ominous threat occurs, they might take up arms in some sense. And in some, these fears or emotions might be considered skin deep, for which they could find treatment.

Some things are easy to learn, since if you are interested in why people do or think what they do, which may be foolhardy, impulsive, self-defeating, or unworthy, people will usually answer your questions and tell their stories, if your interest isn’t merely self-serving or salacious, since mostly everyone likes to talk about themselves and would usually rather speak than listen. Most people will divulge more than you want to know. People often want to recite the tragic events that have deformed their lives, offering up their pasts as a series of tableaus of deceptions, or unspeakable insults, since people blame others endlessly, and these assaults and imprecations clutter, like a dog’s defecations on the street, their lives and stories. What is said is often unremarkable, though sometimes horrible, but it’s still easy to feel the tiresomeness of another’s life, as well as your own, since interest in other people is also an interest in yourself, because human beings are interested in themselves and in ways of survival. All stories are somehow survival stories, with bad or good fortunes.

If a newcomer who, just the night before, told a beguiling tale that entranced me, but then the stranger proclaims a dim conviction at breakfast, what he or she said previously is revamped by this dimness and I lose interest. If I have recently enjoyed a stranger’s tales, because the narration was vivid, delivered with an awareness of its listeners, though the stranger may have told the story many times before, I can prefer that person’s company to that of long-standing friends, since I am curious about how people live and why, and, in some respects, I’m a xenophile, but in order for my love of a stranger to sustain itself, strangeness must be sustained, and the foreign body mustn’t reveal too much.

The chair designer Harry Bertoia said, “The urge for good design is the same as the urge to go on living. The assumption is that somewhere, hidden, is a better way of doing things,” and that’s sensible, or in my life it is, because I’m looking for a chair that fits me and in which I can feel at home, since homeyness is easier to locate in things than in people, or even in animals, but I like cats, dogs, and chairs almost equally, though I have more control over chairs, which are inanimate, but any cat or dog is in some way pleasing, while most chairs aren’t.

The young woman may believe she can change, even transform, him, so that his poor shoulders straighten and that she might rest her head on them, or that she will lift his spirits in other ways, compel him to shed his carapace and grow a new one. I see them mostly at a distance, though sometimes I have moved nearer, to hear what they say. He fences, a parry-and-thrust dialogist, while she picks words slowly, as she does food, pushing most aside, hoping to hit upon the best one, to please her sense of truth or her companion’s sensibility.

A member of the Philharmonic audience reads the program notes and is prompted to tell someone else how profoundly his innermost being throbs with the pain of this music. He’s read all about it. Beethoven’s pain, Mozart’s pain, Schumann’s pain, Bruckner’s pain, Wagner’s pain. These pains are now his sole property, and he himself is the owner of the Pöschl Shoe Factory or Kotzler Construction Material Wholesalers. Beethoven manipulates the levers of fear, and these owners make their workers jump fearfully. There’s also a Ph.D. here who’s been intimate with pain for a long time.

Furthermore, Erika did not choose a piece for the broadly rolling masses. She decided on a Messiaen, against her mother’s urgent warning. This is no way for the child to smuggle herself into the hearts of the masses, whom mother and child have always despised: the mother because she has always been merely a small, plain part of the masses; and the child because she would never want to become a small, plain part of the masses.

For many of her students, music means climbing from the depths of the working class to the heights of artistic cleanliness. Later on, they too will become piano teachers. They are afraid that when they play at the examination, their sweaty, fear-filled fingers, driven by a swifter pulse beat, will slip to the wrong keys. Erika can talk a blue streak about interpretation, but the only thing the students wish to do is play the piece correctly to the end.

A woman simply has to serve herself with great variety. Erika, one step ahead of him, is already well informed. That is why she pushes the letter at Klemmer, the letter that explains how one can lengthen the hem of the relationship under certain circumstances.

Klemmer nervously licks his lips in the face of control and power. Miniature worlds, like those on TV, open up to him. There’s barely room to put your foot down. This tiny figure stamps about in his brain.

This preliminary awakening of sexuality is generally followed by a quiescent period, the latency period, which lasts until puberty, when both hormonal and sexual activity begin to assume their adult form. Another biological phenomenon parallels this double flowering of sexuality, and that is the development of teeth. We have two sets of teeth; the first, or baby teeth, reach their fullness at about the ages of six to seven, when they fall out and are replaced by the permanent teeth. It is also around this time, six years of age, that most children begin their formal education.

Fat and pale, with an intelligent Circassian bow to her eyes, very humane, overreconciled to a bad lot, taking it for granted that she was too fat to get a husband and forgiving her married sisters and mobile brothers their better luck, she had a genial cry, almost male and fraternal.

That night Franz Polzer was seized by a great, incomprehensible and horrible thought. It happened suddenly. The white line made by the part in her hair shimmered palely. Her body seemed soft and dark. He longed for this body, and suddenly he remembered it was the body of his sister. He knew the thought had no foundation. He had never had a sister. But the idea was too powerful and immediate for him to dispel it.

Karl calls this superstition, but it is not. Perhaps it is the fear of God. God is peace, certainty, and order. But Polzer knew that he could not go to the bank. His arrival would offend Fogl and the others. They couldn’t bear the sight of him anymore. He could not prevent them from pulling the foundation of order out from under him, making everything collapse. There was nothing left but to let it happen. This far from the city, the buildings were more spread out. People seldom walked past Polzer’s bench. The great cloister lay behind him and to the right. To his left, on both banks of the river, he saw factories and a few buildings and fields. Sometimes children or adolescent boys and girls would start playing near the bench. If it seemed like they were not going to leave soon, Polzer got up and went back the same way he had come. One afternoon Polzer was surprised to see Franz Fanta sitting on his usual bench. Franz looked as though he had been expecting him. He rose when he saw Polzer and walked up to him. It had been a long time since Polzer had seen Franz. Franz visited

He did not want it, it should never be. But all of it had to be, since nothing had come to an end. She was ugly and everything was a torment. But everything had to be a torment and everything had to be ugly. Yes ... it could only be his if it were ugly, he himself was ugly, with red hands – oh God, why had he accepted the new suit – he had sold pickles to maids and his aunt had held him while his father beat him, her fingernails digging into his skin, and Milka had seized him on the stairs.

I stayed in the room with him rather than go out and face Mama, who, when the dishes were done and the crumbs shaken off the cloth, would be more lying than sitting in her chair with the Prussian-spiked bulb emitting its glossy villain light through the head on the squashlike wens and bubbles and hard-grained paint of the walls. When she had a grief she didn’t play it with any arts; she took straight off from her spirit. She made no fuss or noise nor was seen weeping, but in an extreme and terrible way seemed to be watching out the kitchen window, until you came close and saw the tear-strengthened color of her green eyes and of her pink face, her gap-toothed mouth; she laid her head on the wing of the chair sideways, never direct. When sick she was that way also.

She had to get herself up and change from worsted stockings—actually golf hose held with snarled elastics—to silk, to black dress, put up her triple-circle coif and, looking mean, powder her face. Not caring how ungentle she looked to us, she mounted her air-sweeping feathers with hat pins and, got up in the condition of ceremony, she went out with an aged quickness of anger, but as she walked down she still had to set both feet on each tread of the stairs.

In 2015 Jason Wiens and Chris Jackson of Kauffman Foundation wrote: “New businesses represent a declining share of the business community. … New firms represented as much as 16 percent of all firms in the late 1970s. By 2011, that share had declined to 8 percent.”13 The next year, John W. Lettieri and Steve Glickman of the Economic Innovation Group wrote that “the U.S. economy has steadily become less entrepreneurial over the past 30 years. That decline turned into a rapid collapse following the Great Recession, when the economy produced hundreds of thousands fewer new businesses than it did in previous recovery periods, marking a lost generation of new enterprise.”

One study found that among small companies in their second, third, fourth, and fifth years of business, more jobs were lost to bankruptcy than were added by those still operating (see figure 5.1). This is why the mean number of workers per firm actually goes down every year after a firm is born. According to the SBA, the mean number of workers in a new firm in its first year is 3.07. But by year 5 this figure declines to 2.36, and to 1.94 in year 11.

Far from replacing the centralized firms of the smokestack era with a decentralized landscape of “electronic cottages” inhabited by burgeoning numbers of the self-employed, the information age has witnessed the development of global corporations and supply chains of unprecedented scale—and the continuing decline of self-employment in the United States and similar economies.

Writing in the Harvard Business Review, Gary P. Pisano and Willy C. Shih coined the term “the industrial commons” for an industry-specific network that can include, among other things, “R&D know-how, advanced process development and engineering, and manufacturing competencies related to a specific technology.”8 Long before it had a name, an industrial commons existed in Silicon Valley based on productive interactions among startups, big firms, university research departments, government agencies, and venture capitalists.

Almost everything in life was vanity—success a vanity, privilege a vanity, Europe a vanity, beauty a vanity. When you stripped away the vanity and stood alone before God, what was left? Only loving your neighbor as yourself. Only worshiping the Lord, Sunday after Sunday. Even if you lived for eighty years, the duration of a life was infinitesimal, your eighty years of Sundays were over in a blink. Life had no length; only in depth was there salvation.

Many of the Spanish-speaking members of the crew took part in an unusual 'banking' scheme where each week all the members of a large group would sign over all their paychecks to one guy. The recipient was selected on a rotating basis, and the way it worked, I gathered, was that for about two months or so everybody squeaked by, doing their best to make do without a check, spending little . . . until the day it was their turn, at which point they came into thousands of dollars and could spend like drunken sailors. This practice made no sense to me. It also required an extraordinary amount of trust in one's fellow cooks.

I saw, for the first time, how two beloved, funny and popular guys can end up less beloved, not so funny and much less popular after trying to do nothing more than what their friends told them they were good at. Friendships, I'm sure, were destroyed.

As a rule, the richest regions are those in which self-employment is lowest, while the poorest are those with the most self-employed inhabitants. Self-employed workers amount to 7 percent of the workforce in North America and 10 percent in the European Union, 22 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean, 36 percent in sub-Saharan Africa, and 41 percent in Southeast Asia.3 The reason, as we noted in chapter 4, is simple: as a rule, the smaller the firm, the lower the productivity level.

After I graduated and was flung into the world of adulthood—already orphaned—I was bolder in my desperation, made frequent appeals to Trevor to take me back. I could hear his cock harden on the phone whenever I called to beg him to come over and hold me. “I’ll see if I can squeeze it in,” he’d say. Then he’d be there and I’d shiver in his arms like the child I still was, swoon with gratitude for his recognition, savor the weight of him in the bed next to me. It was as though he were some divine messenger, my soul mate, my savior, whatever. Trevor would be very pleased to spend a night at my apartment on East Eighty-fourth Street, earning back all the bravado he’d lost in his last affair. I hated seeing that come on in him. One time he said he was afraid of fucking me “too passionately” because he didn’t want to break my heart.

Breaking up big corporations into lots of smaller units does not eliminate the threat of political corruption by special interests as long as trade associations and lobbies representing the selfish and antisocial goals of many small producers can intimidate or bribe politician and officials.

“Harrington has shown that power always follows property. … The only possible way, then, of preserving the balance of power on the side of equal liberty and public virtue, is to make the acquisition of land easy to every member of society; to make a division of land into small quantities, so that the multitude may be possessed of landed estates.”

From the Civil War until after World War II, the United States was in effect two economies—a modern industrial economy in the northeastern-midwestern core and a traditional agrarian, natural resource economy in the periphery. The former exported industrial products to the latter in exchange for food, fiber, and minerals. With the coming of the railroad and telegraph, the expansion of national corporations and markets from the northeastern-midwestern core threatened local elites whose income and status came from their ownership of general stores, small-town banks, mid-sized farms, or other local businesses. It was these local elites who stood to lose—not the workers or farm laborers of the southern and western periphery, who stood to gain—and who provided the social base for the defense of the small and provincial against the large and national.

“Who is this small or independent businessman—the independent producer and the independent distributor?” The rhetorical question was asked by Millard E. Tydings, US senator from Maryland, in 1938: Why, he is an American institution. He is just as much a part of the life of every community as its church or schoolhouse. He knows when there is sickness in the neighborhood, when there is a wedding, a death, or a birth. … He is local business with a heart, and often too much heart for his own good. … I see this great humane and worthy institution, this bulwark of democratic Government—the small independent businessman.

In addition, states and localities, pressed by small retailers, pushed for other legislation to protect them, including Sunday closing laws (to limit competition with mom-and-pop stores whose owners took Sunday off), licensing of florists to keep big chains from selling flowers, and laws curbing advertising of prices. As Stanley C. Hollander wrote in 1980, “The list of all such laws is almost infinite.”

In the early twentieth century, in US counties in which an elite of landowners had disproportionately large landholdings, there were fewer banks and credit was costlier, according to a study whose authors conclude: “The evidence suggests that elites may restrict financial development in order to limit access to finance, and they may be able to do so even in countries with well-developed political institutions.”59

Far from defending freedom and democracy for ordinary Americans against plutocracy, the antimonopoly tradition served the selfish economic interests and social prestige of the “local notables” or petty oligarchs of rural and small-town America, particularly in the South and Southwest and Midwest. The very regions—such as the South—that were the most supportive of anti–chain store and unit banking laws that preserved local monopolies for local oligarchs also tended to be the regions of the country most hostile to laws protecting African Americans, organized labor, women’s rights, anticensorship reforms and sexual and reproductive rights.

Economists in this tradition—Schumpeter, Galbraith, Baumol—argued that imperfect competition among large oligopolistic firms in such sectors as manufacturing was a positive good that promoted technological progress, not a dangerous deviation from free market purity. And in a world economy dominated by global oligopolies based in particular nations and often helped by home governments, for one country to pulverize its leading firms inadvertently could lead to the capture of both home markets and foreign markets by the national champions of rival countries. As we will see below, this happened in the United States owing to overly aggressive antitrust policy.

A case in point is the optometry industry, which has a long and checkered history of colluding to keep contact lens customers from being able to buy lenses from other, often cheaper sources, such as Walmart and online seller 1800Contacts. By conventional definition, optometrists don’t possess market power, since most are small, local practices. Moreover, they don’t appear to make supranormal profits that a monopolist might. Nonetheless, the industry has long engaged in anticompetitive behavior to limit the ability of contact lens purchasers to buy contact lenses elsewhere. The industry has this power because it plays a gatekeeper role: customers can’t purchase contact lens without a prescription.102 The industry has used that power to collectively pressure contact lens manufacturers to not sell lenses to lower-cost distributers (particularly online sellers of lenses), making it clear to the manufacturers not toeing the line that optometrists will refuse to prescribe their brand.

At low tide the remains of these crabs strewed the naked mud in front of the quay. Among the flat stones with their manes of rotting seaweed, on the barely slanting blackish surface, in which sparkled here and there a tin can that still had not rusted, a bit of crockery painted with little flowers, a blue enamel skimmer almost intact, their arched, spiny shells could be distinguished next to the longer, smoother shells of ordinary crabs. There was also a considerable quantity of bony legs, or parts of legs—one, two, or three joints ending in a claw that was too long, slightly curved, and sharp-edged—and large, pointed pincers, most of them broken, some of startling size, worthy of real sea monsters. Under the morning sun the whole surface gave off an odor that was already strong, though not quite repellent: a mixture of iodine, fuel oil, and slightly stale shrimp.

The provincial city had declined sadly since its heyday in the later middle ages. It was only rarely a ‘free city’ or city state; only rarely any longer a centre of manufactures for a wider market or a staging-post in international trade. As it had declined, it clung with increasing stubbornness to that local monopoly of its market which it defended against all comers: much of the provincialism which the young radicals and big city slickers mocked, derived from this movement of economic self-defence.

But the cotton manufacture had other advantages. All its raw material came from abroad, and its supply could therefore be expanded by the drastic procedures open to white men in the colonies—slavery and the opening of new areas of cultivation—rather than by the slower procedures of European agriculture; nor was it hampered by the vested interests of European agriculturalists.iv From the 1790s on British cotton found its supply, to which its fortunes remained linked until the 1860s, in the newly-opened Southern States of the USA.

However, another aspect of this diversion of national income from the poor to the rich, from consumption to investment, also antagonized the small entrepreneur. The great financiers, the tight community of home and foreign ‘fund-holders’ who received what all paid in taxes (cf. chapter on War)—something like 8 per cent of the entire national income16—were perhaps even more unpopular among small businessmen, farmers and the like than among labourers, for these knew enough about money and credit to feel a personal rage at their disadvantage.

The reason for this sudden, immense, and quite essential expansion lay in the apparently irrational passion with which businessmen and investors threw themselves into the construction of railways. In 1830 there were a few dozen miles of railways in all the world—chiefly consisting of the line from Liverpool to Manchester. By 1840 there were over 4,500 miles, by 1850 over 23,500. Most of them were projected in a few bursts of speculative frenzy known as the ‘railway manias’ of 1835–7 and especially in 1844–7; most of them were built in large part with British capital, British iron, machines and know-how.

The fundamental fact about Britain in the first two generations of the Industrial Revolution was, that the comfortable and rich classes accumulated income so fast and in such vast quantities as to exceed all available possibilities of spending and investment. (The annual investible surplus in the 1840s was reckoned at about £60 millions.29) No doubt feudal and aristocratic societies would have succeeded in throwing a great deal of this away in riotous living, luxury building and other uneconomic activities.xii Even in Britain the sixth Duke of Devonshire, whose normal income was princely enough succeeded in leaving his heir £1,000,000 of debts in the mid-nineteenth century (which he paid off by borrowing another £1,500,000 and going in for the development of real estate values)30. But the bulk of the middle classes, who formed the main investing public, were still savers rather than spenders, though by 1840 there are many signs that they felt sufficiently wealthy to spend as well as to invest.

Turgot, the physiocrat economist, stood for an efficient exploitation of the land, for free enterprise and trade, for a standardized, efficient administration of a single homogeneous national territory, and the abolition of all restrictions and social inequalities which stood in the way of the development of national resources and rational, equitable administration and taxation. Yet his attempt to apply such a programme as the first minister of Louis XVII in 1774–6 failed lamentably, and the failure is characteristic. Reforms of this character, in modest doses, were not incompatible with or unwelcome to absolute monarchies. On the contrary, since they strengthened their hand, they were, as we have seen, widely propagated at this time among the so-called ‘enlightened despots’.

Its ideal, a golden past of villagers and small craftsmen or a golden future of small farmers and artisans undisturbed by bankers and millionaires, was unrealizable. History moved dead against them. The most they could do—and this they achieved in 1793–4—was to erect roadblocks in its path, which have hampered French economic growth from that day almost to this. In fact Sansculottism was so helpless a phenomenon that its very name is largely forgotten, or remembered only as a synonym of Jacobinism, which provided it with leadership in the year II.

In the course of its crisis the young French Republic discovered or invented total war: the total mobilization of a nation’s resources through conscription, rationing and a rigidly controlled war economy, and virtual abolition, at home or abroad, of the distinction between soldiers and civilians. How appalling the implications of this discovery are has only become clear in our own historic epoch. Since the revolutionary war of 1792–4 remained an exceptional episode, most nineteenth-century observers could make no sense of it, except to observe (until in the fatness of later Victorian times even this was forgotten) that wars lead to revolutions, and revolutions win otherwise unwinnable wars.

With few exceptions, therefore, political opposition on the continent was confined to tiny groups of the rich or the educated, which still meant very much the same thing, for even in so powerful a stronghold of the left as the Ecole Polytechnique only one-third of the students—a notably subversive group—came from the petty-bourgeoisie (mostly via the lower échelons of the army and civil service) and only 0.3 per cent from the ‘popular classes’.

The vast movement for the People’s Charter, which reached its peak in 1839–42 but retained great influence until after 1848, was its most formidable achievement. British socialism or ‘co-operation’ was very much weaker. It began impressively in 1829–34 by recruiting perhaps the bulk of working-class militants to its doctrines (which had been propagated, mainly among artisans and skilled workers, since the early 1820s), and by ambitious attempts to set up national ‘general unions’ of the working class which, under Owenite influence, even made attempts to establish a general co-operative economy bypassing the capitalist. Disappointment after the Reform Act of 1832 caused the bulk of the labour movement to look towards these Owenites, co-operators, primitive revolutionary syndicalists, etc., for leadership, but their failure to develop an effective political strategy and leadership, and systematic offensives by employers and government, destroyed the movement in 1834–6.

From the Blanquists (who in turn derived it from Saint-Just, Babeuf and Buonarroti) the modern socialist revolutionary movement acquired the conviction that its object must be the seizure of political power, followed by the ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’; the term is of Blanquist coinage. The weakness of Blanquism was in part that of the French working class. In the absence of a large mass movement it remained, like its Carbonarist predecessors, an élite which planned its insurrections somewhat in the void, and therefore often failed—as in the attempted rising of 1839.

Consequently those seeking to safeguard private property, enterprise and individual freedom often preferred to give it the metaphysical sanction of a ‘natural right’ rather than the vulnerable one of ‘utility’. Moreover, a philosophy which so completely eliminated morality and duty by reducing them to rational calculation, might well weaken that sense of the eternal fitness of things among the ignorant poor on which social stability rested.

He was evidently not a social revolutionary, but neither was he a conservative; indeed his backers made some play with his youthful interest in Saint-Simonianism (see p. 57 below) and alleged sympathies for the poor. But basically he won because the peasants voted solidly for him under the slogan: ‘No more taxes, down with the rich, down with the Republic, long live the Emperor’; in other words, as Marx noted, against the republic of the rich, the workers voted for him, because in their eyes he meant ‘the deposition of Cavaignac [who had put down the June rising], the dismissal of bourgeois republicanism, the rescinding of the June victory’,11 the petty-bourgeoisie because he did not appear to stand for the big bourgeoisie.

It is instructive to remember that even in the late 1840s intelligent and informed observers in Germany – on the eve of the industrial explosion in that country – could still assume, as they do today in underdeveloped countries, that no conceivable industrialization could provide employment for the vast and growing ‘surplus population’ of the poor. The 1830s and 1840s had for this reason been a period of crisis.

Contemporary observers, their eyes fixed on less fundamental aspects of the economy, would almost certainly have stressed a third factor: the great gold discoveries in California, Australia and other places after 1848 (see chapter 3 below). These multiplied the means of payment available to the world economy and removed what many businessmen regarded as a crippling stringency, lowered interest rates and encouraged the expansion of credit. Within seven years the world gold supply increased between six and sevenfold, and the amount of gold coinage issued by Britain, France and the United States multiplied from an annual average of £4·9 millions in 1848–9 to one of £28·1 millions in each year between 1850 and 1856. The role of bullion in the world economy continues to be a matter of fairly passionate debate even today, a debate into which we need not enter.

Never was economic euphoria among businessmen higher than in the early 1870s, the famous Gründerjahre (the years of company promotion) in Germany, the era when the most absurd and obviously fraudulent company prospectus found unlimited sucker-money for its promises.

However, as we have seen, in practice large bodies of common people, such as peasants, still remained unaffected by nationalism even in the countries in which their participation in politics was seriously considered, while others, notably the new working classes, were being urged to follow movements which, at least in theory, put a common international class interest above national affiliations.

This condemned, with equal implacability, eighty errors including ‘naturalism’ (which denied the action of God upon men and the world), ‘rationalism’ (the use of reason without reference to God), ‘moderate rationalism’ (the refusal of ecclesiastical supervision by science and philosophy), ‘indifferentism’ (the free choice of any religion or none), secular education, the separation of church and state and in general (error no. 80) the view that ‘the Roman Pontiff can and ought to reconcile himself and come to terms with progress, liberalism and modern civilisation’.

An Anglo-Franco-American triumvirate had controlled the Shanghai customs since 1854, but after the second Opium War (1856–8) and the sack of Peking (1860) which ended with total capitulation,viii an Englishman actually had to be appointed ‘to assist’ in the administration of the entire Chinese customs revenue. In practice Robert Hart, who was Inspector General of Chinese Customs from 1863 until 1909, was the master of the Chinese economy and, though he came to be trusted by the Chinese governments and to identify himself with the country, in effect the arrangement implied the entire subordination of the imperial government to the interests of the westerners.

belief that technologically the Japanese could only produce cheaper imitations of western goods formed part of white mythology. Yet there were already hard-headed observers – mainly Americans – who noted the remarkable efficiency of Japanese agriculture,v the skills of Japanese artisans, the potentialities of Japanese soldiers. As early as 1878 an American general predicted that thanks to them the country ‘was destined to play an important part in the history of the world’.17 And as soon as the Japanese proved that they could indeed win wars, the views of westerners about them became considerably less self-satisfied. But at the end of our period they were still seen chiefly as a living proof that the bourgeois civilization of the west was triumphant and superior to all others; and at this stage the educated Japanese themselves would not have disagreed.

In fact, of course, this essentially non-capitalist approach to work benefited employers rather than workers. For the buyers in the labour market operated on the principle of buying in the cheapest market and selling in the dearest, though sometimes ignorant of proper cost-accounting methods. But the sellers were not normally asking the maximum wage which the traffic would bear and offering in return the minimum quantity of labour they could get away with. They were trying to earn a decent living as human beings. They were perhaps trying to ‘better themselves’. In brief, though naturally not insensitive to the difference between lower and higher wages, they were engaged in human life rather than in an economic transaction.

The revolutionary in art could easily be confused with the revolutionary in politics, especially by muddled minds like P-J. Proudhon, and both could be equally easily confused with something very different, namely ‘modernity’ – a word which is first recorded around 1849.

To be ‘contemporary’ in this sense also had implications of change and technical innovation, as well as of subject matter. For if, as Baudelaire perceptively observed, the pleasure of representing the present comes not only from its possible beauty, but also from its ‘essential character of being the present’, then each succeeding ‘present’ must find its specific form of expression, since no other could express it adequately, if at all.

And in doing so, inevitably, each succession of innovators would – at least temporarily – lose the mass of the traditionalists, the philistines, those who lacked what the young Arthur Rimbaud (1854–91) – who formulated so much of the elements of this future for the arts – called ‘the vision’.

Optimism about a future of indefinite progress gave way to uncertainty and a sense of agony, in the classical meaning of the word. All of which strengthened and was in turn strengthened by sharpening political rivalries, the two forms of competition merging in that final surge of land hunger and that chase for ‘spheres of influence’ that have been called the New Imperialism.

For example, some people are prone to take on too much risk while others are too risk averse; some are too focused on the details while others are too big-picture. Most are too much one way and not enough another. Typically, by doing what comes naturally to us, we fail to account for our weaknesses, which leads us to crash. What happens after we crash is most important. Successful people change in ways that allow them to continue to take advantage of their strengths while compensating for their weaknesses and unsuccessful people don’t. Later in the book I will describe specific strategies for change, but the important thing to note here is that beneficial change begins when you can acknowledge and even embrace your weaknesses.

This approach to establishing a “risk-neutral” benchmark position and deviating from it with measured bets was the genesis of the style of investment management we would later call “alpha overlay,” in which passive (“beta”) and active (“alpha”) exposures are separated. The return of a market (such as the stock market) itself is called its beta. Alpha is the return that comes from betting against others.

In this respect, we draw on ideas from Bruce Tuckman (who proposed the four-stages model—forming, storming, norming, performing—for team development in his 1965 paper “Developmental Sequence in Small Groups”), Russ Forrester and Allan Drexler (who explored team-based organization performance in their 1999 paper “A Model for Team-Based Organization Performance”), Pamela Knight (who found evidence that storming takes place throughout the entire lifetime of a team in her 2007 paper “Acquisition Community Team Dynamics: The Tuckman Model vs. the DAU Model”), Patrick Lencioni (who explores common interaction issues in his seminal book The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable), and similar team-focused theories and research.

Victims of their own success, sprint planning for the now eight-person-strong team was a mix and match of requests across their stack of responsibilities. Prioritization was hard, and the frequent context switching even throughout a single sprint led to a dip in people’s motivation. This is not surprising if we consider Dan Pink’s three elements of intrinsic motivation: autonomy (quashed by constant juggling of requests and priorities from multiple teams), mastery (“jack of all trades, master of none”), and purpose (too many domains of responsibility).11

Looking to reward individual performance in modern organizations tends to drive poor results and damages staff behavior. One particularly insidious usage of individual bonuses is when companies use it to leverage their end-of-year profitability. Outstanding individual efforts might receive limited or no bonuses because of a crisis year. This increases the misalignment between the individual’s merits and the bonus they actually receive, leading to frustration and demotivation.

The team made a bold decision to split into microteams, each responsible for a single domain/product area: IDE productivity, platform-server productivity, and infrastructure automation. The two productivity microteams were aligned (and colocated) with the respective product areas (IDE and platform server). Changes that overlapped domains were infrequent; therefore, the previous single-team model was optimizing for the exceptions rather than the rule. With the new structure, the teams collaborated closely (even creating temporary microteams when necessary) on cross-domain issues that required a period of solution discovery but not as a permanent structure. After only a few months, the results were above their best expectations. Motivation went up as each microteam could now focus on mastering a single domain (plus they didn’t have a lead anymore, empowering team decisions). The mission for each team was clear, with less context switching and frequent intra-team communication (thanks to a single shared purpose rather than a collection of purposes). Overall, the flow and quality of the work (in terms of fitness of the solutions for product teams) increased significantly.

The third heuristic is that a team responsible for a complex domain should not have any more domains assigned to them—not even a simple one. This is due to the cost of disrupting the flow of work (solving complex problems takes time and focus) and prioritization (there will be a tendency to resolve the simple, predictable problems as soon as they come in, causing further delays in the resolution of complex problems, which are often the most important for the business).

The last heuristic is to avoid a single team responsible for two complicated domains. This might seem feasible with a larger team of eight or nine people, but in practice, the team will behave as two subteams (one for each domain), yet everyone will be expected to know about both domains, which increases cognitive load and cost of coordination. Instead, it’s best to split the team into two separate teams of five people (by recruiting one or two more team members), so they can each be more focused and autonomous. (See Figure 3.2 on page 44.)

The use of cross-functional, stream-aligned teams has a very useful side effect. Precisely because stream-aligned teams are composed of people with various skills, there is a strong drive to find the simplest, most user-friendly solution in any given situation. Solutions that require deep expertise in one area are likely to lose against simpler, easier-to-comprehend solutions that work for all members of the stream-aligned team.

And although there were things I had intended to say to him, words that had passed through my head many times, words that I had believed needed to be spoken between us, I said only this: I understand. I could understand anything, under the right circumstances and for the right person. It was both a strength and a weakness. I looked at his face and I thought it possible that after all, that despite everything, Adriaan was that person for me.

upper- and middle-class memories have tended to see through a golden haze: the so-called ‘beautiful times’ or belle époque. Naturally this approach has been congenial to entertainers and other media producers, to fashion-designers and others who cater to the big spenders. This is probably the version of the period most likely to be familiar to the public through cinema and television. It is quite unsatisfactory, though it undoubtedly catches one highly visible aspect of the period, which, after all, brought such terms as ‘plutocracy’ and ‘leisure class’ into the public discourse. One may debate whether it is more or less useless than the even more nostalgic, but intellectually more sophisticated, writers who hope to prove that paradise lost might not have been lost, but for some avoidable errors or unpredictable accidents without which there would have been no world war, no Russian Revolution, or whatever else is held to be responsible for the loss of the world before 1914.

If public opinion pollsters in the developed world before 1914 had counted up hope against foreboding, optimists against pessimists, hope and optimism would pretty certainly have prevailed. Paradoxically, they would probably have collected proportionately more votes in the new century, as the western world approached 1914, than they might have done in the last decades of the old. But, of course, that optimism included not only those who believed in the future of capitalism, but also those who looked forward with hope to its supersession.

In the eighteenth century Europeans would have found the Celestial Empire a very strange place indeed, but no intelligent observer would have regarded it in any sense as an inferior economy and civilization to Europe’s, still less as a ‘backward’ country. But in the nineteenth century the gap between the western countries, base of the economic revolution which was transforming the world, and the rest widened, at first slowly, later with increasing rapidity. By 1880 (according to the same calculation) the per capita income in the ‘developed’ world was about double that in the ‘Third World’, by 1913 it was to be over three times as high, and widening. By 1950 (to dramatize the process) the difference was between 1 and 5, by 1970 between 1 and 7.

Still, the speed of the upturn was striking, and almost immediately diagnosed by a particularly sharp-eyed revolutionary, A. L. Helphand (1869–1924) writing under the pen-name Parvus, as indicating the start of a new and lengthy period of tempestuous capitalist advance. In fact, the contrast between the Great Depression and the following secular boom provided the grounds for the first speculations about those ‘long waves’ in the development of world capitalism, which were later to be associated with the name of the Russian economist Kondratiev.

To take only the case of Britain, a country which, at its peak, had dominated the world economy with a ridiculously tiny amount of office work: in 1851 there were 67,000 public officials and 91,000 persons in commercial employment out of a total occupied population of about 9 millions. By 1881 there were already 360,000 in commercial employment – still almost entirely male – though only 120,000 in the public sector. But by 1911 commerce employed almost 900,000, 17 per cent of them women, and the public service had tripled. Commercial employment, as a percentage of the occupied population, had quintupled since 1851. We shall consider the social consequence of this multiplication of white collars and white hands elsewhere.

Partition of the unoccupied parts of the Third World was the logical consequence. In a sense, this was an extension of the protectionism which gained ground almost everywhere after 1879 (see previous chapter). ‘If you were not such persistent protectionists,’ the British premier told the French ambassador in 1897, ‘you would not find us so keen to annex territories.’

Unfortunately for the historian, these problems disappear from the scene of open political discussion in Europe, as the growing democratization made it impossible to debate them publicly with any degree of frankness. What candidate wanted to tell his voters that he considered them too stupid and ignorant to know what was best in politics, and that their demands were as absurd as they were dangerous to the future of the country? What statesman, surrounded by reporters carrying his words to the remotest corner tavern, would actually say what he meant? Increasingly politicians were obliged to appeal to a mass electorate; even to speak directly to the masses or indirectly through the megaphone of the popular press (including their opponents’ papers).

Nowhere was this more obvious than in Austria, where the Liberals by the end of the century were reduced to a small isolated rump of city-dwelling comfortable middle-class Germans and German Jews. The municipality of Vienna, their fortress in the 1860s, was lost to radical democrats, anti-Semites, the new Christian Social party and eventually the Social Democrats.

In 1886 the cottagers in the Belgian valleys round Liège, traditionally manufacturing guns, had no politics. They lived ill-paid lives varied for the males among them only by pigeon-fancying, fishing and cock-fighting. From the moment the ‘Workers’ Party’ arrived on the scene, they converted to it en masse: 80–90 per cent of the Val de Vesdre henceforth voted socialist, and even the last ramparts of local Catholicism were breached. The people of the Liègois found themselves sharing an identification and a faith with the weavers of Ghent, whose very language (Flemish) they could not understand, and thereby with all who shared the ideal of a single, universal working class.

Eduard Bernstein (1850–1932), a self-made socialist intellectual who suggested incautiously, not only that Karl Marx’s theories should be revised in the light of a flourishing capitalism (‘revisionism’), but also that the putative socialist end was less important than the reforms to be won on the way, was massively condemned by labour politicians whose interest in actually overthrowing capitalism was sometimes extremely faint. The belief that the present society was intolerable made sense to working-class people, even when, as an observer of a German socialist congress in the 1900s noted, their militants ‘kept a loaf or two ahead of capitalism’.24 The ideal of a new society was what gave the working class hope.

The ‘villa’ differed from its original model, the country house of nobility and gentry, in one major respect, apart from its more modest (and reducible) scale and cost. It was designed for the convenience of private living rather than social status-striving and role-playing.

The culture of fin de siècle Vienna, it has been argued, was largely that of a class and a people – the middle-class Jews – who were no longer allowed to be what they wanted, namely German liberals, and who would not have found many followers even as a non-Jewish liberal bourgeoisie.6 The culture of the Buddenbrooks and of their author Thomas Mann, himself the son of a patrician in an ancient and proud city of Hanseatic traders, is that of a bourgeoisie which has withdrawn from politics.

In 1858–79, of the British millionaires who died, four-fifths (117) had still been landowners; in 1880–99 only a little more than a third were, and in 1900–14 the percentage was even lower.

Side by side with and overshadowing the old petty-bourgeoisie of independent artisans and small shopkeepers, there now grew up the new petty-bourgeoisie of office, shop and subaltern administration. These were indeed numerically very large strata, and the gradual shift from primary and secondary to tertiary economic activities promised to increase their size. In the USA they were, by 1900, already larger than the actual working class, though this was exceptional. These new middle and lower-middle classes were too numerous and often, as individuals, too insignificant, their social environments too unstructured and anonymous (especially in the big city), and the scale on which economics and politics operated was too vast for them to count as persons or families, in the way in which the ‘upper-middle class’ or ‘haute-bourgeoisie’ could. No doubt this had always been so in the big city, but in 1871 less than 5 per cent of Germans lived in cities of 100,000 or more, whereas in 1910 over 21 per cent did so. Increasingly, then, the middle classes were identifiable not so much as individuals who ‘counted’ as such, but by collective recognition signs: by the education they had received, the places they lived in, their lifestyles and practices which indicated their situation to others who were, as individuals, equally unidentifiable.

Young aristocrats might, as in Britain, try their hand at any form of physical prowess, but their special field was exercise connected with riding and killing, or at least attacking, animals and people: hunting, shooting, fishing, horse-races, fencing and the like. Indeed in Britain the word ‘sports’ was originally confined to such pursuits, the games and physical contests now called ‘sports’ being classified as ‘pastimes’.

Households could be set up as soon as two people reached working age; children, a valuable addition to the family labour force, could be engendered without considering what would happen next to the plot of land on which their future as peasants depended. The complex and traditional mechanisms for maintaining a balance over the next generation between people and the means of production on which they depended, by controlling the age and choice of marriage partners, family size and inheritance, broke down. The consequences for demographic growth have been much discussed, but what is relevant here are the more immediate consequences for the life-histories and life-patterns of women.

But in the new economy the household income was typically and increasingly earned by specifiable people who went out to work and came back from factory or office at regular intervals with money, which was distributed to other family members who, equally clearly, did not earn it directly even if their contribution to the household was essential in other ways. Those who brought back money were not necessarily only men, even though the main ‘bread-winner’ was typically a male; but those who found it difficult to bring back money from outside were typically the married women.

Taking it all in all, we can see nineteenth-century industrialization – using the word in its widest sense – as a process which tended to extrude women, and particularly married women, from the economy officially defined as such, namely that in which only those who received an individual cash income counted as ‘occupied’: the sort of economics which included the earnings of prostitutes in the ‘national income’, at least in theory, but not the equivalent but unpaid conjugal or extra-conjugal activities of other women, or which counted paid servants as ‘occupied’ but unpaid domestic work as ‘unoccupied’.

In the nineteenth century they were increasingly considered as freaks of nature, except at the inferior social levels where poverty and the general lowness of the lower orders made it impossible to regard the large numbers of female shopkeepers and market-women, inn- and lodging-house-keepers, small traders and moneylenders as quite so ‘unnatural’.

collective village communities, whose position as officially recognized institutions had been, paradoxically, reinforced by the liberation of the serfs, and was further reinforced in the 1880s when some bureaucrats regarded it as an invaluable bastion of traditionalist loyalty against social revolutionaries. Others, on the opposite ideological grounds of economic liberalism, pressed for its rapid liquidation by transforming its land into private property. An analagous debate divided the revolutionaries. The Narodniks (see The Age of Capital, chapter 9) or Populists – with, it must be said, some uncertain and hesitant support from Marx himself – thought a revolutionized peasant commune could be the base of a direct socialist transformation of Russia, by-passing the horrors of capitalist development; the Russian Marxists believed this was no longer possible because the commune was already splitting into a mutually hostile rural bourgeoisie and proletariat.

Democratic politics itself had a high-risk element, even in a state like Britain, careful to keep actual foreign policy secret not only from Parliament but from part of the Liberal cabinet. What turned the Agadir crisis from an occasion for potential horse-trading into a zero-sum confrontation was a public speech by Lloyd George, which seemed to leave Germany with no option except war or retreat. Non-democratic politics were even worse. Could one not argue: ‘that the principal cause of the tragic Europe breakdown in July 1914 was the inability of the democratic forces in central and eastern Europe to establish control over the militarist elements in their society and the abdication of the autocrats not to their loyal democratic subjects but to their irresponsible military advisers’?

The Solver is a trusted agent of the organization who goes deep into knotty problems, continuing to work on them until they’re resolved. Folks in this role are moved onto problems identified by organizational leadership as critical and either lacking a clear approach or with a high degree of execution risk.

As a senior leader, you have to maintain a hold on your ego to avoid investing in meaningless work on a grand scale. This can be surprisingly challenging when during your hiring process, you’ve been repeatedly told that you’ve been hired to fix something deeply broken–you’re the newly-hired savior. Of course, your instincts are right!

If you can’t resist the urge to include your most brilliant ideas in the process, then you can include them in your prework. Write all of your best ideas in a giant document, delete it, and never mention any of them again. Now that those ideas are out of your head, your head is cleared for the work ahead.

It’s hard enough to get yourself to listen to your team members and let them know you are listening; getting them to listen to one another is even harder. The keys are 1) have a simple system for employees to use to generate ideas and voice complaints, 2) make sure that at least some of the issues raised are quickly addressed, and 3) regularly offer explanations as to why the other issues aren’t being addressed.

As an engineering leadership team, your goal is to maintain an appropriate technical quality level while devoting as much energy as possible towards the core business. You must balance quality across multiple timeframes, and those timeframes generally have conflicting needs. For example, you’ll do very different work getting that critical partnership out the door for next week’s deadline versus building a platform that supports launching ten times faster next quarter.

Equally important is the idea of limiting concurrent process rollouts. If you try to get teams to adopt multiple new practices simultaneously, you’re fighting for their attention with yourself. It also makes it harder to attribute impact later if you’re considering reverting or modifying one of the new practices. It’s a bit draconian, but I’ve come to believe that you ought to limit yourself to a single best practice rollout at any given time. Channel all your energy towards making one practice a success rather than splitting resources across a handful.

As you identify these leverage points in your work, take the extra time to approach them deliberately. If it’s an interface, integrate half a dozen clients against the mocked implementation. If it’s a data model, represent half a dozen real scenarios. If it’s stateful, exercise the failure modes, check the consistency behaviors, and establish performance benchmarks resembling your production scenario.

If you plot every technical decision as a vector on a grid, the more those vectors point in the same direction, the more you’ll accomplish over time.

我一忽儿计算着自己这次出差如何可以更好的节约下周局长给的那一丁点补助，一忽儿又想着两百万美金的房子是什么样的。环顾前后左右的乘客，虽然都是在经济仓，并且几乎都其貌不扬，可是一想到这里很多人都和这位两厂之主的小老板不相上下，经济成功，有家有室，我突然觉得苦苦思考生死大事实在有些无聊。

毕业十几年了，大家都不约而同地盼望有机会相聚。这种想见见老同学的愿望一般在大学毕业十年后最为强烈，其原因不难理解。光阴似箭，岁月如飞，你身边的东西和你自己都在潜移默化地不停改变，可是由于你每天照镜子，你无法知道你和十年前的自己到底有什么不同，于是你突然想见一个老同学。

批文制度的本意是好的。我们国家制成品成本低，纺织业竞争激烈，如果不用批文控制出口，往往会出现自己和自己竞争，竞相压价。有些还可能为了降低成本而制造伪劣产品，最终会损害中国制造业在国际上的形象

THE LESSER-MINDS PROBLEM. University of Chicago psychologist Nicholas Epley points out that in day-to-day life we have access to the many thoughts that run through our own minds. But we don’t have access to all the thoughts that are running through other people’s minds. We just have access to the tiny portion they speak out loud. This leads to the perception that I am much more complicated than you—deeper, more interesting, more subtle, and more high-minded.

Am I a priority for you?” The answers to those questions are conveyed in your gaze before they are conveyed by your words. It’s a gaze that radiates respect. It’s a gaze that says that every person I meet is unique, unrepeatable, and, yes, superior to me in some way. Every person I meet is fascinating on some topic. If I approach you in this respectful way, I’ll know that you are not a puzzle that can be solved but a mystery that can never be gotten to the bottom of. I’ll do you the honor of suspending judgment and letting you be as you are. Respect is a gift you offer with your eyes.

I spent time with a seventy-year-old working-class Trump supporter in South Dakota who told me about the best day of his life. It happened when he was thirty-four and he was laid off from the factory where he worked as a foreman, because they’d upgraded the equipment and he was no longer skilled enough to do the job. He thought he was just going to leave quietly. He packed his stuff into a box, opened his office door, and found that the entire workforce—thirty-five hundred people—had formed a double line from his office door to his car door in the parking lot. He walked down the line as they applauded and cheered for him. He told me that every job he has had in the thirty-six years since has been worse, and that he and his wife have slid closer and closer to poverty.

A hill on campus might actually have a 5 percent grade, but a typical participant would estimate that it had a 20 percent grade. One day Proffitt took a look at the most recent batch of experimental data and was stunned to find that suddenly the students had gotten much better at estimating the grade of a particular hill. Proffitt and his team delved into the mystery and discovered that the latest batch of questionnaires had been filled out by members of UVA’s women’s varsity soccer team. The hills didn’t look so steep because these were extremely fit Division 1 athletes who would have relatively little trouble walking up them. How you see a situation depends on what you are capable of doing in a situation.

“They loved me the way they loved each other,” Moore wrote, “the only way they knew how: inconsistently and conditionally. From them, I learned that love was something you had to scramble to keep. It could be revoked at any minute for reasons that you couldn’t understand, that you couldn’t control. The kind of love I grew up with was scary to need, and painful to feel. If I didn’t have that uneasy ache, that prickly anxiety around someone, how would I know it was love?”

To recover from painful traumas, people need to live through experiences that contradict what happened to them earlier in their lives. Someone who has been abused has to experience intimacy that is safe. Someone who has been abandoned has to experience others who stayed. This is the kind of knowledge and learning that is held at the cellular level. The rational brain is incapable of talking the emotional body out of its own reality, so the body has to experience a different reality firsthand.

The psychologist Brian Little argues that people generally have on average fifteen “personal projects” going at any one time. These can be small, like learning to surf, or larger, like serving as an apprentice to a plumber.

So when I’m in a conversation with someone now, I’m trying to push against that and get us into narrative mode. I’m no longer content to ask, “What do you think about X?” Instead, I ask, “How did you come to believe X?”

By our late twenties or early thirties, most of us have what McAdams calls an imago, an archetype or idealized image of oneself that captures the role that person hopes to play in society. One person, he finds, might cast himself as the Healer. Another might be the Caregiver. Others maybe be the Warrior, the Sage, the Maker, the Counselor, the Survivor, the Arbiter, or the Juggler.

People come to therapy because their stories are not working, often because they get causation wrong. They blame themselves for things that are not their fault, or they blame others for things that are. By going over life stories again and again, therapists can help people climb out of the deceptive rumination spirals they have been using to narrate themselves. They can help patients begin the imaginative reconstruction of their lives. Frequently the goal of therapy is to help the patient tell a more accurate story, a story in which the patient is seen to have power over their own life. They craft a new story in which they can see themselves exercising control.

When you ask somebody to tell part of their story, you’re giving them an occasion to take that step back. You’re giving them an opportunity to construct an account of themselves and maybe see themselves in a new way. None of us can have an identity unless it is affirmed and acknowledged by others.

The mesmerizing images that stuck in most people’s minds, however, were three poolside shots of a heavily bejeweled Mrs. T. wearing skimpy white bathing suits that revealed her considerable charms to devastating effect. In one double-page image, she appeared to rise mermaidlike from the glistening pool, laden with gold and crystal jewelry by David Webb, exuding a look of breathless elation.

Olive’s marriage to Roy Davidge brought little peace to her family. Her well-to-do father and mother were scandalized that their beautiful daughter was marrying beneath her social rank to a mere Christie’s clerk with limited financial prospects. When she defied them by marrying the man she loved, she was disinherited—an act of cruelty prompted by an unforgiving English class system.

Olive Davidge consoled the distraught teenager, lavishing more affection and tenderness on him than she had ever shown toward her own son. If Christopher was jealous, he kept his feelings to himself. But his world was rent asunder when his mother suddenly announced that she was leaving her husband, Roy, to take up with the teenage Jason. In later years Davidge would profess to be untroubled by his mother’s enduring romance with his closest childhood friend, but some believed otherwise. “Although he always said how proud he is of his mother, inside there is great pain,” Olga Davidge, Christopher’s second wife, observed.

By presenting your mind with the possibility that responsibility has been transferred, you’re putting to good use the wonderful placebo effect—the brain’s inability to distinguish between imagination and reality. As we’ll see in later chapters, the placebo effect works even when we know we’re self-deceiving, perhaps thanks to this natural cognitive delay in disbelief.5
