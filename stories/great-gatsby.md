The Great Gatsby, F Scott Fitzgerald

At nine o'clock, one morning in late July, Gatsby's gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my
door and gave out a burst of melody from its three-noted horn.

It was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his
hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach.

"Good morning, old sport. You're having lunch with me today and I thought we'd ride up together."

He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is
so particularly American -- that comes, I suppose, with the absence of lifting work in youth and,
even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality was breaking through
his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a
tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.

He saw me looking with admiration at his car.

"It's pretty, isn't it, old sport?" He jumped off to give me a better view. "Haven't you ever seen
it before?"

I'd seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream colour, bright with nickel, swollen here and
there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and toolboxes, and terraced
with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind many layers of glass
in a sort of green leather conservatory, we started to town.

I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found, to my disappointment,
that he had little to say. So my first impression, that he was a person of some undefined
consequence, had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate roadhouse
next door.

And then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn't reached West Egg village before Gatsby began
leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his
caramel-coloured suit.

"Look here, old sport," he broke out surprisingly, "what's your opinion of me, anyhow?"

A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that question deserves.





The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first
wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.
